Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,  
Ring ting tingling too  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you,  
Outside the snow is falling  
And friends are calling ""yoo hoo,""  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you.  
  
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,  
Let's go, let's look at the show,  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.  
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,  
It's grand, just holding your hand,  
We're gliding along with a song  
Of a wintry fairy land.  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy  
And comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together  
Like two birds of a feather would be  
Let's take that road before us  
And sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you.  
  
There's a birthday party  
At the home of farmer gray  
It'll be the perfect ending a perfect day  
We'll be singing the songs  
We love to sing without a single stop,  
At the fireplace while we watch  
The chestnuts pop. Pop! Pop! Pop!  
  
There's a happy feeling  
Nothing in the world can buy,  
When they pass around the chocolate  
And the pumpkin pie  
It'll nearly be like a picture print  
By currier and ives  
These wonderful things are the things  
We remember all through our lives!

And I will be your last regret  
  
Cold blood, runs in my blackened heart  
Tearing, every soul apart  
  
[Chorus]  
Messenger of death, wields the scythe  
Of man's damnation  
Messenger of death, hold his blade  
For termination  
  
Sin, is what I feast upon  
I'm forging my crematorium  
Your tomb, is waiting here for you  
Welcome to my ritual

Death rides out from the storm  
We turn to God and cry  
Ignored we turn to face  
This vengeance from the sky  
  
Death rides out from the storm  
No time left to repent  
No quarter, no escape  
No line of self defense  
  
Death rides out from the storm  
In terror we confess  
Our voice is heard no more  
His deed is merciless  
  
Death rides out from the storm  
Deface humanity  
There's no escape from this  
Human calamity  
  
Death rides out from the storm  
We turn to God and cry  
Ignored we turn to face  
This vengeance from the sky

When the only way to get back is to crawl  
  
But the record people love you they can get you on the bill  
Change your name to money dress up fit to kill

And your love's on the back of the bus  
And it's only rock and roll when your records start to sell  
And you don't know why they're making such a fuss

Second that emotion chased into your soul  
Don't worry lest you linger, son it's only rock and roll

There's a hard moon risin' on the streets tonight  
There's a reckless feeling in your heart as you head out tonight  
Through the concrete canyons to the midtown light  
Where the latest neon promises are burning bright  
  
Past the open windows on the darker streets  
Where unseen angry voices flash and children cry  
Past the phony posers with their worn out lines  
The tired new money dressed to the nines  
The low life dealers with their bad designs  
And the dilettantes with their open minds  
  
You're out on the town, safe in the crowd  
Ready to go for the ride  
Searching the eyes, looking for clues  
There's no way you can hide  
The fire inside  
  
Well you've been to the clubs and the discotheques  
Where they deal one another from the bottom of a deck of promises  
Where the cautious loners and emotional wrecks  
Do an acting stretch as a way to hide the obvious  
And the lights go down and they dance real close  
And for one brief instant they pretend they're safe and warm  
  
Then the beat gets louder and the mood is gone  
The darkness scatters as the lights flash on  
They hold one another just a little too long  
And they move apart and then move on  
  
On to the street, on to the next  
Safe in the knowledge that they tried  
Faking the smile, hiding the pain  
Never satisfied  
The fire inside  
Fire inside  
  
Now the hour is late and he thinks you're asleep  
You listen to him dress and you listen to him leave  
Like you knew he would  
You hear his car pull away in the street  
Then you move to the door and you lock it when  
He's gone for good  
  
Then you walk to the window and stare at the moon  
Riding high and lonesome through a starlit sky  
And it comes to you how it all slips away  
Youth and beauty are gone one day  
No matter what you dream or feel or say  
It ends in dust and disarray  
  
Like wind on the plains, sand through the glass  
Waves rolling in with the tide  
Dreams die hard and we watch them erode  
But we cannot be denied  
The fire inside

Trees and flowers were blue  
I stood and held your hand.

We heard the trumpets blow and the sky  
Turned red when I accidently said  
That I didn't know how I came to be here  
Not fast asleep in bed.  
I stood and held your hand.

So I pretend away  
  
That I'm Rudolph Valentino  
Pull up in a limosine  
Oh won't you come in out of the rain  
Things will never be the same  
And then just like Greta Garbo  
You staring like there's no tomorrow  
And you know what I'm thinking of  
Right before your eyes I fall in love with you  
(Do do do do do do do do do do do)  
  
Tody I'm done with games  
Gonna ask you for your name  
Say I've been watching you  
I even know what you do  
Maybe today I'll tell you  
I've found the nerve to sell you  
On a guy like me  
Wishes that he could be  
  
Your Rudolph Valentino  
Pull up in a limosine  
Oh won't you come in out of the rain  
Things will never be the same  
And then just like Greta Garbo  
You're staring like there's no tomorrow  
And you know what I'm thinking of  
Right before your eyes I fall in love with you

Cruisin' in my Cadillac Escalade trickin'  
Sometimes like it easy, sometimes  
Like it rugged  
Keep control, don't ya know  
Hit the floor, run for cover  
Flew around the world about fifty times over  
From New York to la to the white cliffs of  
Dover, the road can be my enemy  
The road can be my lover

Same faces, different places  
Never knowin' where we going now  
Someday I'm gonna die but it  
Won't be from boredom  
If you've got the skills then I suggest

Meet us at the spot 'cause it's  
Gonna be a showdown

With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter  
When questioned who had sent for him, he answered with his thumb  
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter  
  
He stayed behind the assembly hall, it was there he made his bed  
Oftentimes he could be seen returning  
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read  
""The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning""  
  
Oh, the leaves began to fallin' and the seas began to part  
And the people that confronted him were many  
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart  
""If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any""

To talk of this strange design  
Then it goes forever  
Where all things never die  
People look whenever  
These races have been won  
Minds just for breathing  
When the means for this have begun  
It's so far away, and it's closing in  
It's so far away, and it seems to travel in  
  
Taken from the killing ground  
By all dividing hands  
With no sense or reason,  
They came, they found, they ran  
Taking good advantage of  
All the things they are told  
I washed my hands of innocence  
When you started taking control  
  
It's so far away, and it's closing in  
It's so far away, and it seems to travel in

Before you happened to pass by?  
How did I find my way through life,  
Before you brightened up my sky?  
Was there a sky at all,  
Until you painted it for me?  
How did I get on,  
'Till you came along?

To think of you?  
As often as the sun sails out upon the silent sea!

He fell in love with an indian maid over in the antique store  
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show  
So she could never answer yes or no  
  
He always wore his sunday feathers and held a tomahawk  
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk  
Kaw-Liga, too stubborn to ever show a sign  
Because his heart was made of knotty pine  
  
Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss  
Poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed  
Is it any wonder that his face is red?  
Kaw-Liga,that poor old wooden head  
  
Kaw-Liga was a lonely indian, never went nowhere  
His heart was set on the indian maid with the coal black hair  
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show  
So she could never answer yes or no  
  
Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss  
Poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed  
Is it any wonder that his face is red?  
Kaw-Liga,that poor old wooden head  
  
Then one day a wealthy customer bought the indian maid  
And took her oh so far away, but old kaw-liga stayed  
Kaw-Liga just stands there as lonely as can be  
And wishes he was still an old pine tree

With the Blood of the Salnts  
  
Stand on the shore watching the ships as they burn  
None will be found the sea will be their final urn  
Come to me now a moth to the Flame  
Burning your eyes as you stare  
I will devour a Specter of Power I will be King for a Day

In gluttinous sin your face so sublime

Little white duck doing what he oughta  
He took a bite of a lily pad  
Flapped his wings and he said, ""I'm glad""  
That I'm a little white duck sitting in the water  
Quack, quack, quack  
  
There's a little green frog swimming in the water  
Little green frog doing what he oughta  
He jumped right off of the lily pad  
That the little duck bit and he said, ""I'm glad""  
That I'm a little green frog swimming in the water  
Gulp, gulp, gulp  
  
There's a little black bug floating on the water  
A little black bug doing what he oughta  
He tickled the frog on the lily pad

That I'm a little black bug floating on the water  
Quick, quick, quick  
  
There's a little red snake lying in the water  
A little red snake doing what he oughta  
He frightened the duck and the frog so bad  
And he ate the little bug and he said, ""I'm glad""  
That I'm a little red snake lying in the water  
Sss, sss, sss  
  
And now there's nobody left left sitting in the water  
Nobody left doing what he oughta  
Nothing left but the lily pad  
The duck and the frog ran away  
There's nobody left sitting in the water  
Boo, hoo, hoo  
  
Because of the snake that ate the bug  
That tickled the frog, that went kerchug  
There's nobody left to sing about alas and alak  
Not even the little white duck

Audacity  
To say that they can jam it better than us

And there's no need to fight for equality

She was lovely, long hair, short, nice figure though  
So at the funeral, it made me cry, watch her die  
I cannot lie, I couldn't sleep without a wink  
I only think about my lady, I want my baby  
I need her by my side, to hold me, to squeeze me  
  
I still have pictures, but all they do is tease me  
I see my therapist, he only tells me I'm in trouble  
I want my baby back, so now I pack a shovel  
And while I'm digging, it's awfully dark and kinda funny  
Don't dig too fast or to see things could get bloody  
I watch my baby, I hit the top of baby's coffin  
I thinking, she's better off inside if she died  
Yeah, she needs me, I can tell my baby wants me  
'cause every night at 2:15, my baby haunts me

She's as lovely as always, my baby hasn't changed  
Except for the hole that's in her forehead, you can see her brains  
Nevertheless, our love is still forever true  
Her eyes have withered, her skin has now a tint of blue  
My baby's dusty and dirty, and wrinkled clothes  
And now I notice, the maggots chewed off all her toes  
The earth has been rather cruel to my darling sugar  
Is that a bug upon her face? oh, it's just a booger  
I lean her head back to kiss her cracking lips  
And then her neck crack, also does her hips  
I must be gentle, my baby girl's a little rusty  
A little dusty, but most of all, a little musty  
I notice that, when we lay together on the lawn  
We lay till dawn, I notice her left eye is gone  
We said goodbye and everything turned out alright

He helps you through the door  
You sit down on the floor  
And you're asleep before you are alone  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Your life is like a schedule  
You run to meet the bills  
No one's awake to tell you  
Life kills  
  
For a while it seems exhaustion has subsided  
The day is over and the moon is high  
But your period of work is predecided  
Funny how the hours of freedom seem to fly  
Well thank god that there is someone there to drive you  
You know you couldn't make it on your own  
He helps you in the door  
You sit down as before  
Another shift to pay another loan

Who'll be true, who'll change my life of blue  
Into a dream of golden rainbows, where are you?  
  
It seems I've been searching,  
Searching more than just one lifetime.  
My heart is a magnet all for you,

Within my heart is carved  
A sculpture of your love.  
  
Life is worth less than nothing without love.  
Love is the force from which all beings live.

It's the purpose of living to love  
And be loved again and again.  
Where are you?  
My heart cries for you.

A long time ago, from the valley of the sun  
Came the holy power,  
When the gods were one  
Searching for a new home,  
Searching for this land  
Guided by the stars, and a vision they had seen  
The pillars of the temple,  
In these hills of green  
Buried deep inside for only us to find  
(chorus)  
It is the roar of the wind,  
The power of the sun  
The strength of a thousand bows  
And those who near it again, will fear it again  
And it's here in the heart of the rose  
Painted in the sky was the moment to awake  
All that lay within you,  
As this dawn should break  
With this force awoken, none can stand before  
This is the hour, now is the time  
Driven by the purest love, I give you mine  
All that we must be, is everything we see  
  
(chorus)  
Our love, has brought us both together  
And it's our love that will go on forever  
There is no love that can become as one  
Before it's time  
  
(chorus)  
It is the trees in the earth,  
It is the rivers that run  
And through us this secret flows  
And now our destiny calls,  
You'll remember it all  
Our love for the heart of the rose

0,"I was raised a gambler's son  
And before I could walk,  
I had to learn how to run.  
And I never, never ever  
Played a loaded dice.  
But, I rolled a lot of women  
With a heart as cold as ice.  
  
On the run again  
Looking for a place to hide,  
Everywhere I look there is trouble,  
Always coming my way,  
Trouble always coming my way.  
  
Baby I'm lonely, I'm out of control,  
I need someone to understand  
The badness in my soul.  
Though I never, I never  
Stole another man's wife  
But, I fooled around plenty enough  
And I got what I paid for.  
  
On the run again  
Looking for a place to hide,  
Everywhere I look there is trouble,  
Trouble always coming my way.

Looking for a place to hide,  
Everywhere I look there is trouble,  
Trouble always coming my way.

And at keeping things vague

Too much for words to say  
I see her in the morning sleeping  
Yeah she's little and she loves me

Hummingbird don't fly away  
When I'm feelin' wild and lonesome  
She knows just what to say  
She gives me so much understanding  
In her little way  
Lord I gotta say  
In my life I'm gonna love no other  
She's more than I deserve  
She gets me where where I live  
I'd give her everything that's mine to give

Midnight looks right standing more at ease  
Silhouettes and figures stay  
Close to what he had to say  
And one more time the faded dream  
Is saddened by the news  
It cannot be a part of me

infected and disastrous  
It breathes chaotic catastrophe  
it cries to be renewed  
Its tears are the color of anger,  
they dry to form a scab  
To the touch, its stiff and resilient,  
underneath, the new skin breathes  
As outwardly cliche as it may seem,  
yes, something under the surface says,  
""C'est la vie""  
It is a circle, there is a plan  
dead skin will atrophy itself to start again  
Look closely at the open wound  
see past what covers the surface  
Underneath chaotic catastrophe,  
creation takes stage.  
Its all been saved  
with exception for the right parts  
When will we be new skin?  
Its all been seen with exception for what could be

The way things change  
Try an keep it by the reigns  
I'm a lone drifter, big money flipper  
Take anything you got on the rocks in snifter  
I missed her in Kentucky, went down to Louisiana  
I never had no lovin' like I had in Alabama  
A man of my word ain't out to hurt nobody  
I'm just a M see to keep the boogie in the party  
Been singin' lodi dodi since 84  
And I'll be singin' lodi dodi 'til I'm 84  
I couldn't ask for more, life's been sweet  
So you can save the planet,  
I'll save your seat  
  
I been gone for weeks, I ain't slept days  
I can't find myself in this self made maze  
It's been so long since I've been fine  
I'm just tryin' to see the bottom of this bottle of wine  
And I know I'll see better days  
Well I know you'll see things my way  
I never thought about change until  
Spend a little time where time stood still  
Been lookin' for a mill but I keep comin' up shy  
I been a broke fool, I ain't tryin' to be that guy  
Want to ride like lightning, roll like thunder  
I'm tryin' to get some money, I ain't getting any younger  
At times I wonder, at times I won't  
Sometimes I give a fuck but most times I don't  
  
even care, through stained glass windows these eyes stare  
I try to stay straight but it's kickin' my ass  
Every time I look ahead I get a glimpse of the past  
I sit half mass like a soldier's flag  
That's why my left leg limps and my Dickies sag  
It's been so long since I've been fine  
I'm just tryin' to see the bottom of this bottle of wine  
And I know I'll see better days  
Well I know you'll see things my way  
And I know I'll see better days  
Well I know you'll see things my way  
Well I been around this crooked land  
I come across walks, I shook Jim Beam's hand  
I got no plans and no place to go  
It keep getting harder to just say no  
I see the people laugh and people cry  
That's how some live and that's how some die  
Well me myself I'm gonna sit right here  
And I'm a watch this world break down in tears  
All my fears and dark grey skies  
Couldn't crack my smile or break my stride  
Got too much pride, I got too much shout  
I might be down but I still ain't out  
Got too much time and that's all I have  
When I leave this world I'll still be sad  
It's been so long since I've been fine  
I'm just tryin', to see the bottom of this bottle of wine  
And I know I'll see better days  
Well I know you'll see things my way  
And I know I'll see better days  
Well I know you'll see things my way

Carry moonbeams home in a jar  
And be better off than you are  
Or would you rather be a mule  
  
A mule is an animal with long funny ears  
Kicks up at anything he hears  
His back is brawny but his brain is weak  
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak  
And by the way, if you hate to go to school  
You may grow up to be a mule  
  
Or would you like to swing on a star  
Carry moonbeams home in a jar  
And be better off than you are  
Or would you rather be a pig  
  
A pig is an animal with dirt on his face  
His shoes are a terrible disgrace  
He has no manners when he eats his food  
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude  
But if you don't care a feather or a fig  
You may grow up to be a pig  
  
Or would you like to swing on a star  
Carry moonbeams home in a jar  
And be better off than you are  
Or would you rather be a fish  
  
A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook  
He can't write his name or read a book  
To fool the people is his only thought  
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught  
But then if that sort of life is what you wish  
You may grow up to be a fish  
A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish  
  
And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo  
Every day you meet quite a few  
So you see it's all up to you  
You can be better than you are  
You could be swingin' on a star

Your hand was holding tight  
We walked together several miles  
And fading was the light  
So softly then I heard a voice  
You seemed to hear it too  
Then walked on resolutely like  
It wasn't meant for you  
  
But when it came again I stopped  
The voice among the trees  
Came flowing sweetly louder now  
In tones designed to please  
Again you pulled upon my arm,  
""You have to listen now""  
And as you spoke, a chill went through me,  
Freezing me somehow  
  
""The woodland folk and forest creatures living in this glade,  
Have asked me to bring people here for this I am well payed  
The silent song will capture you, enrapture you and then,  
You'll grow roots and bark and leaves, and I'll bring back more men""  
  
""But why"", I asked, not quite aware of what was going on,  
I saw your movements move urgently, but words were drowned in song  
""You are different though"", she said, ""you have something to say,  
It was a big mistake to take you here, let's run away. ""  
  
I tried to run, but couldn't, my head was bathed in sound,  
And I looked down and saw my legs two feet beneath the ground.  
My toes were roots, my fingers twigs, my skin was scaley bark  
And as into an oak I changed, I watched you in the dark  
Completing your transaction with the nebulous green crowd,  
Of tiny dancing forest people, singing very loud.  
  
A celebration for a tree, and then I understood,  
My initial feelings in this melancholy wood  
I know I felt the change in you, when we finally kissed,  
I looked but you were surrounded by, a tapestry of mist  
  
I picture you, as wind blows through our leaves and over land,  
Every tree that stands with me for money changing hands.

I can fly so close to the sun, that i can not see it rise  
Going round in circles, in a silent sky

I can not say why

Show me the fire, in a true believer's eye  
Just a traveler, on an endless flight  
But no matter which way i turn, i journey into the night  
Going round in circles, till the mountains fall  
To believe in so many truths  
Makes no sense at all  
Makes no sense at all

Watch it grow into a night

It felt like breath of air  
Usually I just walk these streets

Sometimes the shape I'm in  
Won't let me go.  
  
Well, I don't know too much for true

My legs know how to love someone  
My voice knows how to sound.

Shame that it is a shame.

I watched your taillights blaze into nothingness  
But you were long gone before I ever got to you  
Before you blazed past this address  
  
And now I think of having loved and having lost  
But never know what it feels like to never love  
Who can say what's better when my heart's become the cost  
A mere token of a brighter jewel sent from above  
  
Fare thee well my bright star  
The vanity of youth the color of your eyes  
And maybe if I'd fanned the blazing fire of your day-to-day  
Or if I'd been older I'd been wise  
  
Too thick the heat of those long summer evenings  
For a cool evening I began to yearn  
But you could only feed upon the things which feed a fire  
Waiting to see if I would burn  
  
Fare thee well my bright star  
It was a brief brilliant miracle dive  
That which I looked up to and I clung to for dear life  
Had to burn itself up just to make itself alive  
  
And I caught you then in your moment of glory  
Your last dramatic scene against a night sky stage  
With a moment so clear that it's as if you're still before me  
My once in a lifetime star of an age  
  
So fare thee well my bright star  
Last night the tongues of fire circled me around  
And this strange season of pain will come to pass  
When the healing hands of autumn cool me down

0,"Love, what have you done? Oh, wow.  
I was sure up to now that she was a friend.  
I stayed till the end. Don't be a fool again.  
I once believed that love was fair.  
But I don't anymore. She said I'm a bore.  
My heart hit the floor.  
  
Don't be a fool anymore.  
Each time around.  
I tell myself it's the game of love.  
Ignore the signs and risk it all in the name of love.  
Well, I've decided I can't let nobody hurt me again.  
So I'll say to the end  
I just don't want to be a fool. (Don't want to be a fool.)  
Said I don't want to be a fool ever again.  
  
Whenever a fool's in love he doesn't know he's to blame.  
He's caught in the game. It all ends up the same.  
He doesn't feel the shame. He looks at love in a diff'rent way.  
It breaks his heart ev'rytime they all turn out strange.  
  
But he'll never change. He's never gonna change.  
Next time around I'll tell myself it'll be better than before  
I won't look back.  
There'll be no one tearing my heart out anymore.  
I just decided I can't let nobody fool me again.  
So I'll swear to the end.  
I just don't want to be a fool. (Don't want to be a fool.)  
Said I don't want to be a fool (ever again)  
No way, (I mean no more) Never again (Oo, no never)  
I can't be a fool, can't be. No way. No way. No way. Oo.  
I don't want to be. I don't want to be a fool. No.  
I can't love anybody (I can't love nobody)  
walking on a one way street. (Any way, any way any, way no.)  
If I don't (If I don't) find somebody (somebody body )  
that'll be alright with me. (know, I know it'll be alright now)  
'cause I decided not to let nobody kill me again.  
So I'll stay to the end  
I just don't want to be a fool. (Don't want to be a fool)  
Said I don't want to be a fool. (Don't wanna be a fool)

I'm staring up at the sky  
Which at this lonely moment is my only friend  
And suddenly as I gazed upon the night  
Well I notice the stars  
They began to shake and dance and burst  
And fall into the darkness  
They exploded down, I knew what I had to do  
I ran up to the top of the hill  
And I took a hold for you  
You were the sweetest star that fell  
And yes, I held onto it close to the numbness in my heart  
And then I kissed a star, yes I did  
I wrapped it up inside of a golden bow  
And then I ran away just to find you  
'Cause this was your gift, your gift, oh shit  
A star that I kissed  
Oh the galaxy that lives inside your eyes  
Was in need, I said it was in need  
Of a, of a brand new shining light  
I said I wished to the dark sky above  
That all I had was to be captured  
And willingly turned over to you  
I know you better now and at this I smile  
I simply gave to you the symbol of what you are to me  
You are the star that shines  
And explodes with light and I love and embrace  
Love and embrace all that I can  
You better take this blindness and stay away from me  
And let me bask inside of your golden seam  
I never knew such simple astronomy  
I never knew it could come to me and not by the ways of the heart  
And call on me to be one of those strangely dressed wise men  
Who follow the stars to their love  
You are such a perfect star to wish upon  
Well I love you and God and I'm hopeful  
Of what this lonely night may lead me to  
So I said god I'm hopeful  
Of what this lonely, lonely night  
Will lead me tonight  
Oh well, well I'm hopeful that this lonely night  
Well it shines so right, I'm hopeful  
I'm hopeful of all good things to come about

0,"I met my old lover on the street last night  
He seemed so glad to see me  
I just smiled  
And we talked about some old times  
And we drank ourselves some beers  
Still crazy after all these years  
Oh still crazy after all these years  
  
I'm not the kind of girl who tends to socialize  
I seem to lean on old familiar ways  
And I ain't no fool for love songs  
That whisper in my ears  
Still crazy after all these years  
Still crazy after all these years  
(Crazy, I'm gonna crazy, I'm gonna crazy)  
  
Four in the morning, crashed out, yawning  
Longing my life away  
I'll never worry  
Why should I?  
It's all gonna fade  
  
Now I sit by my window  
And I watch the cars  
I fear I'll do some damage one fine day  
But I would not be convicted by a jury of my peers  
Still crazy after all these years  
Oh, still crazy  
(Baby I'm crazy through all these years)  
Still crazy  
Still crazy after all these years

Somehow come together  
Caught in the moment  
Blind with desire  
The way I want of you

Moving way too fast  
Jumping through the fire  
  
I can't regret you  
Somewhere we went wrong  
I won't forget you

Before we started fading  
Could not see eye to eye  
Pretending nothing's wrong  
We open up our eyes and asked when love was gone  
I still think about you  
And how you've been  
Getting by without you

Until another night

The fish and chips smell lingers  
Under amber streetlamps  
She holds the law in her hands  
The moistness of the damp night  
Falls silent through the lamplight  
Although she's only fourteen  
She really knows her courting  
And up the railway sidings  
There's him and her  
They're lying  
Hand in hand they whisper  
You're my missus and I'm your mister  
The moon as white and virgin  
And she was on the turning  
Remember your first nibble  
When best friends were so little  
  
They really trooped the colors  
When walking with each other  
And all her mates would giggle  
As ladylike she'd wiggle  
All along the high street  
They'd splash out on an ice cream  
He'd sometimes really treat her  
But he'd done his mother's meter  
  
Well he went off to borstal  
He said that he was forced to  
Rob the flats of hi fi's  
'cause she was ill  
And she would cry  
Each morning she got sicker  
Her mother sometimes hit her  
If she'd have known the story  
She would have been so sorry  
  
He received a letter and admitted it  
There was nothing else to do but get rid of it  
Lonely in his dormitory  
He'd sit and stare  
If this is for real  
And is it really fair  
  
Summer came so they went  
Down to the coast in his tent  
She cooked upon his primus  
And sampled local cider  
She told him in his rucksack  
I think i want that chance back  
To be perhaps the one who  
Will forever love you

so glad to see you my friend, it's been a while.  
Searching, Fearless  
where do I begin to heal this wound of self-denial?  
  
Face yourself man!  
Brace yourself and trace your hell back.  
  
You've been  
Blinded,  
Living lie a one way  
Cold existence,  
All the while.  
Now it's  
Time to  
Stare the problem right between  
The eyes  
You long lost child.  
  
I want to feel your body breaking,  
Want to feel your body breaking,  
And shaking,  
And left in the cold.  
I want to heal your conscience making  
A change to fix this dying soul.  
This Dying Soul.  
  
Born into this world a broken home  
Surrounded by love yet all alone  
Forced into a life that's split in two  
A mother and a father both pulling you  
Then you had to deal with loss and death  
Everybody thinking they know best  
Coping with this shit at such an age  
Can only fill a kid with pain and rage  
Family disease pumped through your blood  
Never had the chance you thought you could  
Running all the while with no escape  
Turning all that pain in to blame and hate  
Living on your own by twenty one  
Not a single care and having fun  
Consuming all the life in front of you  
Burning out the fuse and smoking the residue  
  
Possessive obsessions,  
Selfish childish games.  
Vengeful resentments,  
Passing all the blame.  
  
Living out a life of decadence  
Acing without thought of consequence  
Spreading all your lies from coast to coast  
While spitting on the ones that matter most  
Running power mad with no control  
Fighting for the credit they once stole  
No one can ever tell you what to do  
Ruling other's lives while the can't stand the thought of you  
  
A living reflection,  
Seen from miles away.  
A hopeless affliction,  
Having run astray.  
  
I want to feel your body breaking,  
Want to feel your body breaking,  
And shaking,  
And left in the cold.  
I want to heal your conscience making  
A change to fix this dying soul.  
This Dying Soul.  
  
Now that you can see  
All you have done,  
It's time to take that step  
Into the kingdom.  
All your sins will  
Only make you strong,  
And help you break right  
Through the prison wall.  
  
Come to me my friend  
(Listen to me)  
I'll help this torture end  
(Help to set me free)  
Let your ego go  
(I can't carry this load)  
You can't go through this alone  
(I feel so hopeless and exposed)  
You'll find your peace of mind  
(Give me some direction)  
You can no longer hide  
(Break out of this isolation)  
Let humility  
(Openness, honesty)  
And become what you can be  
(A healing tranquility)  
  
Help me,  
Save me,  
Heal me,  
I can't break out of this prison all alone.  
  
These tormenting ghosts of yesterday,  
Will vanish when exposed.  
You can't hold onto your secrets,  
They'll only send you back alone.  
  
Your fearless admissions  
Will help expel your destructive obsessions.  
With my help I know you can  
Be at one with God and man.  
  
Hear me,  
Believe me,  
Take me,  
I'm ready to break right through this prison wall.

All I do, is want to be  
Somebody, can you feel what I feel  
I try my best, to keep it real  
And pay dues  
[Z-Ro]  
Extra extra read all about it, I'm going crazy  
Ro raging with motherfuckers smoking, going eighty  
Miles per hour, pass up the city gel on my collar  
Trying to locate and half of it, that will give a nigga some power  
Not saying that I'm weak, bullets gon hang when I speak  
I bust a brain if I reach, and get that thang off my seat  
I'm in love with selling, that's why I ain't winning that much  
Gas money looking funny, wheels ain't spinning that much  
But I'ma make it the way of the other, cause I can't stop  
People trying to trick me of my mission, but I can't drop  
Cause I can't fall, run up I'ma keep bumping my lead  
Before the game over I know, I'ma be dumping my lead  
Because I'm nervous by nature, the slightest move will get you shot  
I've been known to help niggas make it, to they burial plot  
Not my lifestyle, I love the way the feddy stack  
Record labels stealing Z-Ro, to CEO gon get it back  
[Hook]

Sometimes, I feel like doing myself  
Sixty percent of my body is drank, I ruin myself  
But I'm addicted, eyes fucked leaning and look inflicted  
With my facing revelations, tripping on what it predicted  
Cause it's happening, when the trumpet blow  
Ain't gon be no mo' laughing and, it's to the left or the right  
I hope I get to go to heaven, I hear heaven is tight  
Plus they tell me that hell is hot, and they won't give you no ice  
I need a cool wrist, most of these bitches be the devil trying to fool me  
Taking my kindness for weakness, and trying to use me  
Bitch fuck your hair and your nails, you bout to lose me  
I sleep with my uzi, cause she ain't gon steal from me if I nod off  
The only place I don't let her go, is in God house  
I'm a gangsta fa sho, you better believe me  
I bet I'll be on that doja, every time you see me  
[Hook]  
[Z-Ro]  
I done made up my mind  
Hustle all alone, I'm trying to get up some mo' shine  
Every time I turn around, someone bringing me down  
Got tired of em pulling on me, started slanging them rounds  
And now they thinking I'm a crazy  
Scarred and stabbed and shot, I'm still a baby, I want my mama  
Cause I'm having bad dreams, and I die in em all  
Got me ain't friendly when you see me, ain't no smiling at all  
I live the thug life, heartless and hopeless  
Laying low ducking the law, with long you lusting and acting douches  
I'm connected, my best friend use to be I-10  
Until my out of town connect, put out your chest and took my ends  
Got me throwed off in the mind, retaliation's what I take  
Fears get blowed off with my nine, incarceration's what I face  
Feel me, I done lost my mind, but it's all gravy baby  
I get tipped for knocking bustas off daily

Squeezing complicated lives into a simple headline  
I have your face in an old Polaroid  
Tidying the childrens clothes and toys  
You smiling back at me I took the photo from the fridge  
Can't remember what Emily did  
Haven't been with a woman, it feels like, for years  
Thought of you the whole time, your salty tears  
This shitty world sometimes produces a rose  
The scent of it lingers but then it just goes  
  
Return the call to home  
  
The worst of us are a long drawn-out confession  
The best of us are geniuses of compression  
You say you're not gonna leave the truth alone  
I'm here 'cause I don't wanna go home

Soldier brings oranges he got out from a tank  
Waiting on the waiter, he's taking a while to come  
Watching the sun go down on Lebanon  
  
Return the call to home  
  
I got a head like a lit cigarette  
Unholy clouds reflect in a minaret  
So high above me, higher than everyone  
Where are you in the cedars of Lebanon?  
Choose your enemies carefully, 'cause they will define you  
Make them interesting 'cause in some ways they will mind you  
They're not there in the beginning but when your story ends

Watching you pretend you're unaffected  
You're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go  
But I won't  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
No you don't need my protection  
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking  
I look in your direction, hoping that the message goes  
  
[Chorus]  
Somewhere close to you  
Close to you  
Like so close if they heard you, you wouldn't find out  
Just say now, I'm coming right now, to be close to you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Said you let it go, you kept it  
Working hard to perfect it  
Now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control  
Would you let it go?

No you don't need my protection  
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking  
I look in your direction, hoping that the message goes

If you let me, I'd be there by now

But so are many others  
So I feel like tryin' to hide  
My head 'neath these covers  
  
Life is like the seasons  
After winter comes the spring  
So I'll keep this smile awhile  
And see what tomorrow brings  
  
I've been told and I believe  
That life is meant for livin'  
And even when my chips are low  
There's still some left for givin'  
  
I've been many places  
Maybe not as far as you  
So I think I'll stay awhile  
And see if some dreams come true  
  
There isn't much that I have learned  
Through all my foolish years  
Except that life keeps runnin' in cycles  
First there's laughter, then those tears  
  
But I'll keep my head up high  
Although I'm kinda tired  
My gal just up and left last week  
Friday I got fired  
  
You know it's almost funny  
But things can't get worse than now

I can feel your golden skin on mine  
Beneath the desert sky

To their hopes and betrayals and your only reply  
Is Slainte Mhath

Parading their anecdotes tired from old campaigns  
Holding their own last orders commanding attention

Time to take her home her dizzy head is  
Conscious laden  
Time to wait too long, to wait too long,  
To wait too long.

Hear the chestnut horses neigh!  
See the mice all scurry,  
See the farmers hurry,  
When it's time for  
Bringing in the hay!  
  
Good smells coming from the kitchen,  
We'll get lots of treats today!  
Cattle are a-mooing  
Pigeons are a-cooing,  
As they watch us  
Bringing in the hay!  
  
Pitchforks shining in the sunlight,  
As the farmers work all day,  
They were early starting,  
And they won't be parting,  
'Til we finish  
Bringing in the hay.

Such frail-looking lady  
The sadness of her lone display  
Dressed in yellow fire burning  
The corner dweller on the lane  
Sorrow was her only feeling  
For she could have no living shame  
Take thee care and time  
To sow your own true seed  
The summers end will bring your leaving

And she was never in his mind  
Came he home to just a memory

0,"I found the perfect picture, of a perfect stranger.  
It looked as if, it were taken in the forties sometime,  
Judging by the style.  
He could be a killer or a blind man with a cane,  
Perhaps he died in a car crash, years ago.  
Right now, it's impossible to tell.  
I almost thought I saw him, standing, whistling on a bridge.  
I asked him the time, but when he turned around,  
I saw it wasn't him at all.  
I'm still searching.  
I'm still searching.  
I saw him in an airport, while he was sitting on a wing.  
And I waved to him, but I don't think he noticed me.  
I've got a funny feeling I know who he is.

To where the thunder of a voice

No longer running through the night  
A conversion to the light  
Giving way to disbelief, and you say

0,"Near Banbridge Town in the County Down  
One morning last July  
A boreen green came a sweet colleen  
And she smiled as she passed me by  
She looked so sweet from her two bare feet  
To the sheen of her nut brown hair  
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself  
For to see I was really there  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down  
As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head  
And I looked with a feelin' rare  
And I says, says I, to a passer-by  
""Whose the maid with the nut brown hair?""  
He smiled at me and he says's, says's he  
""That's the gem of Ireland's crown  
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of a Bann  
She's the star of the County Down""  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down  
At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there  
I'll dress in my Sunday clothes  
My shoes shone bright and my hat cocked  
Right for a smile from my nut brown rose  
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke  
Till my plough turns rust colored brown  
Till a smiling bride, by my own fireside  
Sits the star of the County Down  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen  
That I met in the County Down  
From Bantry Bay down to Derry Quay and  
From Galway to Dublin Town  
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen

Hey yo, I'm still not a playa but you still a hater  
Elevator to the top hah, see you later, I'm gone

In house beach, French Countess, ten thou piece  
Rent-out lease, with a option to buy  
Coppin' a five-oh Benz for when I'm not, far up in the sky  
Puffin the lye, from my Twinzito  
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens, nicknamed Perico  
We go back like PA's and wearin' PJ's  
Now we reach the peak age, runnin' trains for three days  
Who wanna ride it won't cost you a dollar  
Whether soft or harder of course you still gonna holla  
My, my, I'm big huh, I rip my, through your

Hold up, chula, I'm all about gettin' loot  
But I knock that boot, if you out to get hoof  
Well, I don't wanna be a playa no more  
I'm not a playa I just crush a lot  
But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin' for  
Uptown baby, uptown  
Well, I don't wanna be a playa no more

But you know Big Pun and Brock still down behind  
Who's down to crush tonight  
I don't wanna be a playa no more  
I'm not a playa I just crush a lot  
But you know Big Pun and Brock still down behind  
I love from butter pecan to blackberry molass'  
I don't discriminate, I regulate every shade of the  
Long as you show class, and pass my test  
Fat, highly intelligent bachlorettes  
That's the best, I won't settle for less  
I wanna get a brunette, with unforgettable sex  
I lay your head on my chest, come feel my heartbeat  
We can park the Jeep, pump Mobb Deep, and just spark the  
It's hard to creep since I found Joe  
Every pretty round brown, wanna go down low  
But this Boogie Down professional, I'ma let you know  
Once I quit the blows, get your clothes, 'cause you got to go  
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere  
You nasty Brock, I don't care  
Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns  
Take time, known to make a chick  
Up in the hot tub, bubbly  
Rubbin' your spot love, got you screamin', ?Punish me?  
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked  
When I stick it even Luke be like, 'Don't stop, get it get it'  
Up in the hot tub, bubbly  
Rubbin' your spot love, got you screamin', ?Punish me?  
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked

All is stripped away  
And I simply come  
Longing just to bring  
Something that's of worth  
That will bless your heart  
  
I'll bring you more than a song  
For a song in itself  
Is not what you have required  
You search much deeper within  
Through the way things appear  
You're looking into my heart

And it's all about you

When it's all about you  
It's all about you, Jesus

We could take a bath.  
I want to see you again.

And hearts intertwining high above,  
And if frankly we'll see things my way,  
We will climb the heights of love.  
I want to see you again.  
It doesn't matter where or when.  
I want to see you again.  
I'm just beginning to have no end.  
Perfect love.

Only livin' to survive

Underneath the same blue sky

Nothin's standin' in my way

Hit you and your ho up  
From the torso up  
Leave y'all there till the coroner or the law show up

Why cop?, I rob you, ice your roll up  
I pop bottles, ain't no need for no cup  
Roll the pure 'dro up, stroll the floor tore up  
The difference between fab and y'all, after I pick an auto up  
Every month I ain't gotta give more doe up  
Fuckin' with this you'll buy a washer when the shore slow up  
I have it when ya kids see-saw go up

Check these diamonds, no flaws show up  
My niggas clap up parties, shoot tour shows up  
What y'all know bout head till a chicks jaw swoll up  
Goin' gold minutes after the gates on stores go up  
You know who done it now, few hundred miles  
And with shoes on it now

When we run up this guns to stomach style  
Got to flaunt it now

Yo, you must wanna die  
From the nigga you testify against  
Fabolous make bail before they identify the prints  
Swing by a Vince, in a buggy eye with tents  
Sitting on nineteen's, gun stash by the vents  
Niggas is looking at the chain cause they eyes squint  
I pull up, pull out, pull back  
Them guys will sprint  
Last nigga that talked slick and been replyin' since  
Got a deal, no sellin', been supplyin' since  
Leave niggas on the ground like tire prints  
We done make ya eyes look bent, just by the sense  
These niggas don't believe, then they gone die convinced  
Once I present the four fifth why comment  
I'm the type you tell ya dame bout  
Push a fellow brain out  
Leave'em in front of the spot that they sell cocaine out  
One single, had to tint the yellow range out  
Everybody runnin' up tryin' to spell the name out (f-a-b-o-l-o-u-s)

"
0,"To have every man but to love only one  
To wake with the moon and sleep with the sun  
To be a sinner, a saint, a lover, a friend  
To know a beginning but never and end  
To fly in the ocean and swim in the skies  
Believer in truth, defendant of lies  
To know the purest love, the deepest pain  
To be lost and found again, and again, and again  
These are the dreams of an Impossible Princess  
  
To know the power of wealth and poverty  
To taste every moment and try everything  
To be hailed a hero, branded a fool  
Believe in the sacred and break every rule  
To give into pleasure with no boundaries  
Living in chaos and harmony  
To feel the touch of a man, a woman's caress  
To know the limit of torture and tenderness  
These are the dreams of an Impossible Princess  
  
It's a way of dealing with all the feeling keep believing in dreams

So I turned your photograph over face to the wall  
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight  
Teardrops will fall  
Teardrops will fall tonight  
Tears I can't hide  
Tears that I'd rather keep  
Deep down inside  
Tears from a love that's gone beyond these walls  
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight  
Teardrops will fall  
I'm gonna pray tonight, baby  
Hopin' you will hear  
And maybe you'll write all those wrongs  
And dry each tear  
I sit alone tonight  
Hopin' you will call

0,"I should've known better than to look in your eyes  
'Cause that's what got me thinking of the love we had shared  
Your spell lives on forever- Oh, you captured my heart  
How could I forget you, or the love we had made  
Seems like only yesterday, when I held you in my arms  
And you would softly whisper: ""I'll never leave""  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cry forever- cry for the dreams we had  
Where did our love go, do you ever think of me?  
Cry forever- cry for the dreams we'll never share  
You made me love you, hen you turned your back upon me now  
Oh, I remember lying side by side  
Your heart gently beating, softly with mine  
Your face just like an angel, smiling up at me  
The hunger and the passion, when we'd set our love free  
Now the clock is slowly ticking in this empty room  
The images are haunting like a candle through the gloom  
Cry forever...  
I dreamed about you last night and the vision was so clear  
Of you and I together with no pain, lies or tears  
I woke up late this morning, with you still on my mind  
I could swear that you were with me, I was back there in time  
Pictures in the night, can't sustain the light of day  
I need someone to hold me, who'll never fade away  
Cry forever...  
Do you ever think of me.. at all?

I didn't notice what time it was

I'll be spending time with you  
  
Every day's a new day in love with you  
With each day comes a new way of loving you  
Every time I kiss your lips my mind starts to wander  
And if all my dreams come true  
I'll be spending time with you  
  
Oh, I love you more today than yesterday  
But not as much as tomorrow  
I love you more today than yesterday  
But, darling, not as much as tomorrow  
  
Tomorrow's date means springtime's just a day away  
Cupid, we don't need ya now, be on your way  
I thank the lord for love like ours that grows ever stronger  
And I always will be true, I know you feel the same way too  
  
Oh, I love you more today than yesterday  
But not as much as tomorrow  
I love you more today than yesterday  
But only half as much as tomorrow  
  
Every day's a new day, every time I love ya  
Every way's a new way, every time I love ya  
Every day's a new day, every time I love ya  
Every way's a new way, every time I love ya

old friends of mine.  
I thought if I'd climb up ole Ajax mountain maybe that would help me get it
all off my mind.  
I made it up to the top, picked out a clear spot. I thought a whole lot about
the rest of my life.  
I had no idea then soon it would nearly end up on this mountainside I would
nearly die.  
and there all in Alabama and there all in dixieland.  
God I'm dying here in Montana please Lord, just want to go back to hold her
hand just let me get back to my old homeland.  
They said I'd never sing again I learned a lot about my friends 'cause when
your shot down and out you don't get many calls  
but I saw some tears in some eyes and soon my poor old mother would die I
nearly lost it all when I lost my Grandpa.  
But you could find us all in Alabama yeah we're all down in Dixieland  
I didn't die out in Montana No Lord you let me get back to my own homeland and
I'm gonna hold on to her hand.  
I done a whole searching a whole lot of hurtin' before I finally found my road
in life  
you got to say things you want to say go on and do things your own way you can
climb any old mountain once you make up your mind  
and I made mine in Alabama and I found mine down in Dixieland  
I didn't die out in Montana no Lord you let me get back to my ole homeland and
I'm gonna hold on to her hand.

This dirty road is taking me  
Sometimes I can't even see the reason why  
I guess I keep a-gamblin'  
Lots of booze and lots of ramblin'  
It's easier than just waitin' around to die  
  
One time, friends, I had a ma  
I even had a pa  
He beat her with a belt once 'cause she cried  
She told him to take care of me  
Headed down to Tennessee  
It's easier than just waitin' around to die  
  
I came of age and I found a girl  
In a Tuscaloosa bar  
She cleaned me out and hit in on the sly  
I tried to kill the pain, bought some wine  
And hopped a train  
Seemed easier than just waitin' around to die  
  
A friend said he knew  
Where some easy money was  
We robbed a man, and brother did we fly  
The posse caught up with me  
And drug me back to Muskogee  
It's two long years I've been waitin' around to die  
  
Now I'm out of prison  
I got me a friend at last  
He don't drink or steal or cheat or lie  
His name's Codine  
He's the nicest thing I've seen  
Together we're gonna wait around and die  
Together we're gonna wait around and die

Don't think I don't want to please you  
No child of mine 'll be bearing

And they talked a lot of slack  
  
But oh, what a revelation  
When much to my surprise  
Then came you, wonderful you  
Right before my eyes  
  
5 minutes away, 5 minutes away  
You know I been  
All around the world to find  
It was right at my door  
  
5 minutes away, 5 minutes away  
I found love, love  
Just minutes away  
  
Everybody's got a story  
And it ain't nothing new  
I'm talking to the one  
Who's been looking for love  
And it just might be you  
  
While you're running around  
Hanging all around town  
With a fool that ain't no good  
But that very special someone  
Could be right in your neighborhood  
  
5 minutes away, 5 minutes away  
You know I went  
All around the world  
Just to find it right at my door  
  
5 minutes away, 5 minutes away  
You see, I found love, love, love  
Just minutes away  
  
Times when love ain't easy  
It's a game that we all play  
And the prize that we pay  
Is sometimes much too high  
  
Take it from me and don't look too far  
Love might be in your own backyard  
There's a better chance to find romance  
Just by starting today  
  
5 minutes away  
You know I went  
All around the world  
To find it right at my door  
  
5 minutes away, 5 minutes away  
You know, love, love, love  
Could be minutes away  
I said, love, love, love  
Is just minutes away  
  
5, 5, 5, 5 minutes away

And listen to this  
I am a hermit of burial ridge  
Once I was shaven and worked every day  
But the call of the wild just lured me away  
Singing hi hi ho it's a water a day  
On my way to an unmarked grave  
Hi hi ho it's a water a day  
On my way to an unmarked grave  
  
There's pals at my table and mud on the floor  
There's bears in the area and wolves at the door  
Their singing a song about cookie McBride  
Who goes out a-trapping and then tails their hide  
  
Hi hi hey it's a water a day  
On my way to an unhappy grave  
Hi hi hey it's a water a day  
On my way to a rain filled grave  
So if you're planning a natural trip  
Don't call up snooping on burial ridge  
The searchers will come and discover your hide  
High, wet and hanging like cookie McBride  
  
Hi hi hey it's a water a day

Hi hi hey it's a water a day

To dream the impossible dream  
To fight the unbeatable foe  
To bear with unbearable sorrow  
To run where the brave dare not go  
To right the unrightable wrong  
To love pure a chaste from a far  
To try when your arms are too weary  
To reach the unreachable star  
This is my quest to follow that star  
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far  
To fight for a right  
  
Without question or pause  
To be willing to march into hell  
For a heavenly cause  
And I know, if I'll only be true  
To this glorious quest  
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm  
When I'm laid to my rest  
And the world will be better for this  
That one man scorned and covered with scars  
Still strove with his last ounce of courage  
To fight the unbeatable foe

0,"When you meet a special person  
And it feels good passing time  
You tell yourself it's casual  
But they have something else in mind  
  
You try to make some reason  
A voice calls out from across the room  
She runs away without an answer  
She runs away too soon  
  
[Chorus:]  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's crying  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's crying  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's crying  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's crying  
  
We all belong to someone  
Sometimes they're so far away  
You write down words in letters  
Not quite sure what they say  
  
You know that she needs you  
And you miss her in your heart  
But a certain feeling lingers  
That keeps us miles apart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Oh Lord)  
Somewhere tonight  
Someone's crying  
Somewhere tonight

Back of my neck gettin' dirty 'n' gritty  
Been down, isn't it a pity  
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city  
All around people lookin' half dead  
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head  
But at night it's a different world  
Go out and find a girl  
Come on, come on and dance all night  
Despite the heat, it'll be alright  
Babe, don't you know it's a pity

In the summer, in the city

Cool town, evening in the city  
Dressed so fine and looking so pretty  
Cool cat, looking for a kitty  
Gonna look in every corner of the city  
Till I'm wheezing like a bus stop  
Runnin' upstairs, sayin' meet you on the roof top

One did every heartache and I would lose myself to you

Watching the sun and city lights  
Thinking of you  
Wondering where I lose my mind  
  
After all I'm excited that you're in my life again

I believe that you can fall in love with me again

There was a part of you that knew  
I was all that you wanted  
But only shadows fill the room  
I was lost all right  
Lost in the sleepless empty nights  
Dreamin' of you  
And in those dreams you were mine  
  
After all reunited  
Yeah you're in my arms again  
After all I'm delighted  
Cause our we're lovers and we're friends  
I believe that I can  
Fall in love with you again  
And I'll catch you when you fall

Set him down up there on a picnic bench  
And he used to play checkers with them other old menup there  
They used to tell stories bout when they were kids  
Grandpa says he shot the Chief of Police when he was nine years old  
I believe it  
Cause they tell me Harlan Knetucky was the baddest place in the world  
Why they say they used to sit out there on their front porch  
Shoot them revenuers when they'd come down the hollow  
Said they was so young took two of them boys  
To hold the rifle and one to pull the trigger  
Well grandpa he'd lie a little bit  
But I'll tell you there's a lot of stories in Harlan County  
  
Yeah folks in Harlan County Lord they knew that we were poor  
They always called my daddy Preacher Dan  
But daddy weren't no preacher least ways I don't recallect  
Never hear of papa talk of nothin' but the land  
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer yes he was  
Could not read nor write Lord he could barely sign his name  
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer all his life someday when I'm grown I'll be the
same  
  
Well he always grew tobacco though he did not smoke himself  
He had the best tobacco crop around  
And he never touched a drop of liquor that I can recall  
Papa made his livin' on the ground  
Yes Sunday go to meetin' called for more than he could stand  
I guess he felt at home in his old clothes  
But he never missed a Sunday takin' mama to the church  
Maybe it was habit Lord but heaven only knows  
Daddy was a God fearin' farmer...  
[ steel - fiddle ]  
Yeah folks in Harlan County Lord....  
Someday when I'm grown I'll be the same someday when I'm grown I'll be the

Are working like you want them to  
As I break down and you stay strong  
I write my own forgiveness song  
  
I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug

Another night and it's only right  
I toss and I turn in the bed I made  
  
The wine dark room the flashing eyes  
That hung me from my string of lies  
You said you were numb from wondering  
I guess I wasn't listening

But you're not concerned  
Another night and it's only right  
That I toss and I turn in the bed I made

I fashioned this frame  
And into the wood  
I carved out my name  
  
I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug

Cause I'm awake in my room  
I been up for thirty eight hours  
And it don't look like sleep's coming soon  
  
Cause I could break like a bird  
Or I could swallow the sea  
It seems like the daylight is coming  
And no one is watching but me  
  
But I don't mind the dark discovering the day  
Cause the night  
Is a beautiful bright blue and grey  
  
And what brings me down now is love  
Cause I can never get enough  
  
And it's a dangerous time for a heart on a wire  
Shuttled from station to station noisily  
Now knowing why  
  
So I put my head on the ground  
And the sky is a wheel  
Spinning these days into things that I've lost  
But you can keep all the years  
  
But I don't mind the days gone rolling away  
Cause this sunlight  
Feels warm on my face today  
  
And what brings me down now is love  
Cause I can never get enough of love

That you're still somewhat  
Attached to the dream  
Of being in love once again  
When it's clear they've moved on  
  
So I sat down and wrote these few words  
On the off chance you'd hear  
And if you happen to be somewhere listening  
You should know I'm still here  
  
If you really need me  
Baby just reach out and touch me  
You don't ever have to be  
Downhearted again  
If she hurts you or misleads you  
Baby all you ever need to do  
Is call me and let love rush in  
  
What can I say, I had a little extra time  
So I figured I might as well explain  
A couple little things to you  
That you probably never knew  
Like you'll always be an intrinsic part of me  
Even though life goes on  
  
If you really need me  
Baby just reach out and touch me  
You don't ever have to be  
Downhearted again  
If she hurts you or misleads you  
Baby all you ever need to do  
Is call me and let love rush in  
  
And in my love will flow  
Like the waves to the shore  
You can fall into me  
Once again effortlessly  
And I'll comfort you so  
  
Your heart won't hurt anymore  
I'm waiting patiently  
  
If you really need me  
Baby just reach out and touch me  
You don't ever have to be  
Downhearted again  
If she hurts you or misleads you  
Baby all you ever need to do

Voice of angels, such a divine sight  
An Amazon to fight and cure  
This reality with her feline lure  
  
Patriotic to the promised land of Neverwaking Dream

Playing his lute, charming every lass  
Joins the troop with a glitter in his eye

Took the dive just to feel alive

You don't see me in the hood, it's cause I'm doing this man  
  
Niggas, I'm still grinding (yeah), I still hearing those sirens  
I'm still getting chased by those lights  
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on  
And my time is none, because I'm writing more  
I don't hear to meet a soul in this business  
I'm here to eat, speak, until these ho's feel this  
I ain't gonna let you derail me, man  
I got Young Kobe homey, you gotta let go of Obie  
Cause Obie be back, (going nowhere, man) we got them craps going on  
And that yak going on, soon as a nigga touch down, back from town  
It's forever, put that on the cheddar, man  
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time  
Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out  
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about  
Now I'm here, so shut your motherfucking mouth, and show me love, bitch  
  
[Chorus]  
I just want to love, for the rest of my life (I don't love you, bitch)  
I want to hold you in the morn, hold you thorough the night  
(Right we want to love alcohol, we want to love guns, we want to love money  
we don't love no bitches, though)  
I just want to love, for the rest of my life

You can't sit still, it's like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep  
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap  
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped  
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically  
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money  
You can't pay me enough for you to play me  
It's cockamamie you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady  
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's coo-coo  
I got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle, I'm just brutal  
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it, there's no more humor in it, you

You need a fag and tear a new hole in my ass, you better love me, bitch

My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name  
If it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain

Nine eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce  
I ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit  
Let me find out he fucking 'round with Bow Wow bitch  
Niggas eating popcorn, right, rewinding the tape  
Now shorty mama in the precinct hollering rape  
I'm convinced, man, something really wrong with these ho's  
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fucking with her nose  
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet  
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats  
That nigga D'Angelo, he determined not to fail  
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell  
My back shot to help Ashanti hit them high notes  
And Big Ben taught Charlie B 'More to deep throat (yea)

Burns like a fire inside  
Look out my window  
Sometimes it's hard to see  
The things you want in life

And now I think I'll make a brand new start  
She took the last train out of my heart

Thinking 'bout the plans we made  
The days turn into years  
Funny how they fade away  
Sometimes I think of those days  
Sometimes I just hide away  
Waiting on that 9:20 train  
Waiting on a memory  
  
She took the last train out of my heart oh, oh  
She took the last train  
And now I think I'll make a brand new start

My love is like a steam train rolling down the tracks yea, yea

Sliding down the banister in your Sunday suit  
Lying on a slag heap of blankets and magazines  
She's only thirty-five going on seventeen  
You'd better roll over and go to sleep if you don't come clean

And in every home there will be lots of time  
I will be all yours you might have been admired  
(And in every home there will be lots of time)

Oh heaven preserve us  
Oh heaven preserve us  
Oh heaven preserve us  
Because they don't deserve us

With an artificial limp wrist  
And so a young blade becomes a has-been  
Looking for a new twist  
  
A year after the wedding he broke all their china plates  
He's in prison now she's running with his mates  
Sees him every Sunday  
And he asks her where she's been  
She's only thirty-five going on seventeen  
She's going to cop a packet if he ever finds her  
In between the sheets

I rode a dream so wild and free for all that dream was worth.  
But true love is both a blessing and a curse.  
Today my heart just settled back to Earth.  
  
Now I know just how you felt that night so long ago.  
But the dream for you had ended and you let me know.  
So I bounced from sky to sky,  
Tryin' to keep the dream alive.  
But everything I did just made it worse.  
Guess my heart just settled back to Earth.  
  
Love created songs that I still sing.  
Love we knew still makes the rafters ring  
Tonight I'll sing for everything I'm worth.  
For all the hearts that settle back to Earth.  
  
Songs our love created I still sing.  
Love we knew still makes the rafters?red?.  
Tonight I'll sing for everything I'm worth.  
For all the hearts that settle back to Earth.

Our hearts just finally settled back to Earth

Of what could be again.  
Fact or fiction, deep intuition  
Of wondering how and when.  
Once in a thousand years  
The secrets of the past  
Will change the way we see.  
Across the ocean, the world's emotions  
Are in and out of time.  
The changing seasons, no rhyme or reason,  
The choices, cruel or kind.  
One day it's clear, then clouds appear  
'cause nothing stays the same.

It's how you play the game.  
But then the day will come around  
We'll turn the world upside down.

Where the blood red journey ends  
When you've faced the heart of darkness  
Even your soul begins to bend  
  
For a week I have been waiting  
Still I am only in Saigon  
The walls move in a little closer  
I feel the jungle call me on  
  
Every minute I get weaker  
While in the jungle they grow strong  
What I wanted was a mission  
And for my sins they gave me one  
  
They brought it up just like room service  
Cause everyone gets what they want  
And when that mission was all over  
I'd never want another one  
  
I know, captain that you've done this work before  
We've got a problem you can help us all I'm sure  
The colonel's gone rogue  
and his methods are unsound  
You'll take a PBR up river track him down  
  
There's a conflict in every human heart  
And the temptation is to take it all too far  
In this war things get so confused  
But there are some things which can not be excused  
  
He's acting like a god an insane lunatic  
Your mission, exterminate with extreme prejudice  
The route is dangerous and your progress may be slow  
Here is the file and it's all you need to know  
  
Here I am the knife in my hand  
And now I understand why the genius must die  
  
Now I stand alone in darkness  
With his blood upon my hands  
Where sat the warrior the poet  
Now lie the fragments of a man

I made a meal of trips to school upon my father's bike  
I used to sit between his legs, perched on a piece of wood  
If it ever rained on us, I'd slip beneath his hood  
And at home the radio was on  
From Julie Andrews to Jerry Garcia  
Life was all fun and games  
I was out of my head and underneath my bed  
Playing with electric trains  
  
At home the stereo was on  
My head was filled with rock  
I played a willow cricket bat guitar  
And soloed round the clock  
My records stacked up in a pile  
Collected from the charts  
And Top of the Pops  
  
Kneeling with torchlight shining  
Before me in my bed  
My eyeballs stuck in readers wives  
Pubic hairs proudly counted everyday  
Manhood took me slowly  
Out into the milky way  
  
I chased the girls and made them cry  
My hair grew down my back  
The passing of my teenage years  
Were spent down in the sack  
I played guitar and formed a band  
I puked up all night long  
  
As people came to sit and stare  
While I raced through my songs  
The sound of music passed by me  
Just like the Grateful Dead

Ain't nuthin' changed

Whippin' something mean  
The whole shorts in the Rolls Royce is off  
For sure, bouncin' the bar on my next world tour  
When we hit the sick, I'm the cure  
We 'bout to pop it off so wild, hit the floor  
Ain't nobody botherin' you  
All I'm thinkin' 'bout is clobberin' you  
Immigration always sayin' I'm harboring a few  
Illegal aliens  
Females, mostly Latins and Israeli-ans  
The top story, evening news  
I'm the shit, they been deceiving you  
Drop the roof on the Coupe D'Ville  
Shoot to kill  
Ask niggas, Duke is real  
Stay lookin' for the loot to steal  
He determined  
Don't try to touch Bad Boy, cause we burnin'  
I want my glory  
Duke is not a joke, and I ain't gotta story  
Every time I grab the mic it's with the sole intent  
To rip shots and give you 2OO percent  
Man, I'm tired of doin' dirt  
Tired of being on the the run from Wyatt Earp  
Rather be somewhere in a quiet church, sayin' prayers  
Not only sayin' mine, but sayin' theirs  
That's cause my dogs ain't there

My God's a big God he rises from the sea  
My God's a big God the stars surround his shoulders  
My God's a big God but small enough to live in me  
  
My God's a strong God he made the mighty mountains  
My God's a strong God but he holds me gently in his hands  
My Gods a loud God his fingers snap like thunder  
My God's a loud God he rocks the hemisphere  
My God's a loud God he echoes through the ages  
My God's a loud God but he whispers softly in my ear

0,"I'm far away from home out on the dashing foam,  
Just how far I have traveled I'll never know,  
Sometimes I feel so blue and I long for home and you,  
But I must stay and fight the foe.  
  
So I'm sending you red roses to tell you my love is true,  
And I send them so you will know dear that I'm always thinking of you.  
Enclosed you will find my heart dear so treat it with tender care  
And every time you look inside dear you'll find my love is there.  
  
May each petal be a memory of the happiness we knew,  
Each thorn may tell a story of the heartache that I've been through,  
So I'm sending you red roses although we're oceans apart,  
And remember when they fade dear that you'll always have my heart.

She comes and goes  
She breaks my heart each day  
And never knows,  
And the time I spend in sorrow  
Will match the time I live  
And the time that's left is  
All I have to give.  
  
The woman's like an ivy on a pole  
She wraps her twisted love around my soul  
There will come a sudden winter  
When she'll seek the warmth of day  
And there'll come a time when she will come to stay.  
  
The woman's like the tide  
She comes and goes  
She knows the things that I can just suppose.  
And the time I spend in sorrow  
Will match the time that she laughs  
And the songs I sing cannot explain but half.

When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac  
He was dress like 1950  
Half drunk and hollow eyed  
He said its a long walk to Nashville would you like a ride son  
  
Well I sat down in the front seat  
He turned on the radio  
And them sad old songs coming outta them speakers was solid country gold  
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white pale  
When I asked him for a light  
And I knew there was something strange about this ride

He said drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing  
Have you paid your dues?  
Can you moan the blues?  
Can you bend them guitar strings?  
He said boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?  
'Cause if your big star bound let me warn you it's a long hard ride  
  
Well he cried just south of Nashville  
And he turned that car around  
He said this is where you get off boy  
I'm goin' back to Alabam  
And as I stepped outta that Cadillac  
I said mister many thanks  
He said you don't have to call me mister mister  
The whole world calls me Hank

by Cole Porter  
  
With a million neon rainbows burning below me,  
And a million blazing taxis raising a roar,  
Here I sit, above the town,  
In my pet-paillated gown,  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor.  
While the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet,  
And the bars are packed with couples calling for more,  
I'm deserted and depressed  
In my regal-eagle nest,  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor.  
When the only one you wanted wants another,  
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?  
Why, even the janitor's wife  
Has a perfectly good love life,  
And here I am, facing tomorrow,  
Alone in my sorrow,  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor

We'll take it a bit slower  
This is, this is the, huh, this is the first song I ever learned, actually  
Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts  
Lordy, how they could love  
  
Swore to be true to each other  
Yeah, true to the skies above  
He was her man, wouldn't do her no wrong  
And Frankie and Johnny went walkin'  
  
And Johnny had on a new suit  
Yeah, Frankie spent one-hundred dollar notes  
Just to make her man look cute  
He was her man, he wouldn't do her no wrong  
  
Frankie went over to the barroom  
Stopped for a bottle of beer  
Said to the old bartender man  
Has my lover Johnny man been here?  
  
He was my man, Lord, but he'd been doin' me wrong, so wrong.  
Yeah Frankie looked over the transom door  
And then to her great surprise  
There sat her lover man Johnny  
  
Makin' love to Nellie Bly  
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong  
Well Frankie lifted up her kimono dress  
And she drew (ladaladalala) out a little .44  
  
She shot once, twice, three times (three times) she shot him  
And through that hardwood (door) floor  
Yeah she shot her man (yeah he was her man)  
Well but he been doin' her wrong yeah  
  
He said, roll me over so careful ah  
Roll me over so slow,  
Oh roll me on to my left hand side,  
Because your bullet hurt me so,  
  
I was your man, but I been doin' you wrong.  
Play it Chris!  
  
Well they sent for Frankie's mother  
Come down to Huddy's saloon  
To see what's the matter with her boy  
She come down, Frankie looked up at her  
  
Here what she said:  
She said, Oh Mrs. Johnson, oh forgive me please  
Well I killed your lovin' son, Johnny  
But I'm down on my bended knee  
  
I shot your man, 'cause he was doin' me wrong. ah  
She said, I'll forgive you Frankie,  
She said, I'll forgive you not, not  
For killin' my lovin' son Johnny,  
  
He's the only support that I've got,  
'Cause you shot my man and he was doin' you wrong.  
Well the last time I seen Frankie  
She was a-sittin' in a dungeon cell  
  
She would be there moanin', herself  
With no one there to care  
She shot her man, a he'd been doin' her wrong, so wrong  
Well bring out the overtime hearse all day long  
  
You gotta bring out the pony and truck hey  
They're gonna take Johnny, Johnny to the cemetery (graveyard)  
And they ain't never coming back  
Oh he was her man, oh but he been doin' her wrong, so wrong  
  
Well the story ain't got no moral, Lordy  
But the story ain't got no end  
Well the story only goes to show  
That there ain't no damn good in men  
  
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong

These white pills aren't kind  
I've given a lot of thought on this 13 hour drive  
I miss the grinding concrete where we sat past 8 or 9  
And slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights  
I've given a lot of thought to the nights we use to have  
The days have come and gone  
Our lives went by so fast  
I faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor  
Where I laid and told you but you swear you loved me more  
  
Do you care if I don't know what to say  
Will you sleep tonight, will you think of me  
Will I shake this off pretend it's all okay  
That there's someone out there who feels just like me  
There is  
  
Those notes you wrote me  
I've kept them all  
I've given a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall  
With every single letter in every single word  
There will be a hidden message about a boy that  
Loves a girl  
  
Do you care if I don't know what to say  
Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me

Newspaper hinted suicide,

A tainted truth was all it said,  
Sleep tight now that  
You've made your bed  
An arrow that once pierced your heart  
Points to the apple on your head  
  
Three sides to every story  
Yours, mine  
And, Monday morning's  
  
Cupid's dead, headlines read,  
Cupid's dead  
Cupid's dead, headlines read,  
Cupid's dead  
  
Oh, romeo, oh, romeo  
Where did our love go, romeo?  
If you read between the headlines,  
You wouldn't be the last to know  
No mystery yet to unfold,  
A paperboy left in the cold  
A love was said to never die,  
Withered away and just got old  
  
'our top story tonight,  
Is a crime of passion  
The victim, an unidentified man,  
Is found in bed, wearing only a diaper,  
Holding a bow an arrow in one hand,  
And clutching a letter in the other.  
The letter simply read  
Cupid's dead.'

Your feelings are wasted,  
Tasted the sweetness,  
But now you're faced with,  
The thought, of being alone  
Nor more companionship,  
You can handle it,  
Just abandon it,  
Leave it behind,  
And look for the brighter day  
Give it some time,  
Cause it won't come right away  
You gotta be standing strong,  
Hold on to your dignity  
Don't sit around,  
Saying look what ya did to me  
It's time to move on,  
You gotta continue  
To look for a love,  
Of a life that's within you  
Cupid is dead now,  
It's time to rely on,  
Yourself to cope  
You got no shoulder to cry on  
Dead

Selling lanterns on the streets,  
I remember the Child  
In the manger as He sleeps.  
  
Wherever there are people  
Giving gifts, exchanging cards,  
I believe that Christmas  
Is truly in their hearts.  
  
Let's light our Christmas trees  
For a bright tomorrow  
Where nations are at peace  
And all are one in God  
  
Let's sing Merry Christmas  
And a happy holiday,  
This season may we never forget  
The love we have for Jesus  
Let Him be the One to guide us  
As another new year starts  
And may the spirit of Christmas  
Be always in our hearts.  
  
In every prayer and every song  
The community unites,  
Celebrating the birth  
Of our Savior, Jesus Christ  
  
Let love, like that starlight  
On that first Christmas morn,  
Lead us back to the manger  
Where Christ the Child was born  
  
So, come let us rejoice  
Come and sing a Christmas carol  
With one big joyful voice  
Proclaim the name of the Lord!

Trying to trace it or erase it

Full throttle, gonna rip some ass.

Romance the road, winding left to right.

A feeling inside me and the whole world to see.

Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do.

Hundreds of miles rolled off today.  
Signs lose their meanings, minutes tick away.  
Dirt roads to interstates, I must have drove them all.  
Cigarettes and burgers, caffeine and alcohol.  
Drive until daybreak, always on the go.

A gated community cops can't come in  
A neighborhood for punks over the hill  
We're spendin' our golden years in Mattersville  
  
We can do whatever we want whenever we please  
There's always a keg of beer and a block of cheese

We will grow old together we will play bridge and Texas hold 'em  
Duane and Stevie Cab they still skateboard

Crying when I go outside.

Never thinking wed be put in jail  
You might say that we were green, I was barely seventeen  
When they put those bars between old Merle and me  
  
Late one night we hit the wall, twenty feet we had to fall  
To the ground where we could craw into the weeds  
Waiting for that shotgun blast, never thinking we could last  
We sure had to grow up fast, old Merle and me  
  
We were young and crazy then, it was easy to pretend  
Acting like wed never been in reform school  
Looking danger in the eye, walking with our heads held high  
We were not afraid to die, old Merle and me  
  
We were living by the gun, never caring what wed done  
Swearing it was all just fun and games you know  
We would die and go to hell before we broke our vow to tell  
How we escaped that prison cell, old Merle and me  
  
How was Merle or me to know, we would end up on death row  
Waiting for our turn in the electric chair  
Shot down in a grocery store, we got busted at the door  
Praying wasn't easy for old Merle and me

anymore, was at one time reputed to be a dance of unbridled passion, back in
the old days when it wasn't so easy to get your rocks off, when it was hard to
make contact with a member of the. .. Opposite camp, and you had to resort to
things like dancing close together and going hey. .. Those were the days.
Well, those days are probably gone forever, I don't know, unless Nixon is
going to bring them back a little bit later, but, we have this very special
highly evolved permutated tango. It's actually a perverted tango. By the time.
.. Yes, it's so perverted! This is the ""Be-Bop Tango,"" a special entertainment
event that includes choreography a little bit later, so watch out, folks. ..
You can turn on the big lights, we may need 'em. You know, the ones in the
audience. Heh heh heh. Okay, you're ready? Not too fast now 'cause I wanna get
the right notes on the tape 'n this, this has to be the one. This has to be
the one with all the right notes on it. Okay, 're you ready? 'n this is a hard
one to play. .. One, two, three, four. ..  
  
Fz: The cowbell as a symbol of unbridled passion, ladies and gentlemen.  
  
Fz: Now, as you might have noticed, Bruce Fowler has just completed some sort
of trombone solo, based on the, uh, idea of an evolved tango-event. Bruce has
also prepared for you a demonstration of a dance that he hopes will sweep the
ocean, right after the Mud Shark did. Bruce is now warming up the important
muscles of the body, in preparation. .. In preparation for the Real Live Be-
Bop Tango which we're gonna demonstrate. Napoleon will assist him.  
Napoleon: Wait a minute now. ..  
Fz: Napoleon, just put your horn down, just relax, put your head back, here
comes the drill. Okay, ha ha ha, you know what I'm talkin' about? Okay. ..
This is sort of like jazz in it's own peculiar way. .. Jazz is not dead, it
just smells funny. .. Okay, let's go!  
George: Yeah, man, jazz, man, you know what I mean?  
  
This is Be-Bop,  
Even though you think it doesn't sound like that  
  
(Be-Bop. .. ! That's no Be-Bop!)  
  
Fz: Now, as you might have noticed, some of you with a musical education can
tell that the notes that George just sang when he went: ""This is Be-Bop, even
though you think it doesn't sound like that,"" it's actually a sort of a
twisted form of the theme of the tango itself which will get de. .. Even more
depraved as the number goes on. George will now attempt to dismember that
melody, play it and sing it at the same time while. ..  
  
Pe-dop!  
  
Fz: Hey, that's the way. .. While we sort of dance to it, okay? Try it,
George. ..

George: As I was saying. ..  
Fz: Now, what we'd like to do at this point is get some volunteers from the
audience to. .. I know you will, oh God, you will. .. We need some. .. Heh heh
heh. .. Now, as a matter of fact you did, didn't you. .. No, we wanna have
some people who've never tried it before, who've never even thought of trying
it before. A boy, a girl, preferably who like each other, who would like to
come up here and attempt to dance to what George sings. ..

Fz: Do we have anybody whose. .. ? You're one. Okay, what's your name?

For small mercies

No room for weakness  
I covered every crack in the wall  
But there ain't no way that I can  
Keep this secret  
'Cause when you go

0,"My name is Donald White, you see,  
I stand before you all.  
I was judged by you a murderer  
And the hangman's knot must fall.  
I will die upon the gallows pole  
When the moon is shining clear,  
And these are my final words  
That you will ever hear.  
  
I left my home in Kansas  
When I was very young,  
I landed in the old Northwest,  
Seattle, Washington  
Although I'd a-traveled many miles,  
I never made a friend,  
For I could never get along in life  
With people that I met.  
  
If I had some education  
To give me a decent start,  
I might have been a doctor or  
A master in the arts.  
But I used my hands for stealing  
When I was very young,  
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,  
That's how my life begun.  
  
Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,  
I found they were my kind,  
And it was there inside the bars  
I found my peace of mind.  
But the jails they were too crowded,  
Institutions overflowed,  
So they turned me loose to walk upon  
Life's hurried tangled road.  
  
And there's danger on the ocean  
Where the salt sea waves split high,  
And there's danger on the battlefield  
Where the shells of bullets fly,  
And there's danger in this open world  
Where men strive to be free,  
And for me the greatest danger  
Was in society.  
  
So I asked them to send me back  
To the institution home.  
But they said they were too crowded,  
For me they had no room.  
I got down on my knees and begged,  
""Oh, please put me away,""  
But they would not listen to my plea  
Or nothing I would say.  
  
And so it was on Christmas eve  
In the year of '59,  
It was on that night I killed a man,  
I did not try to hide,  
The jury found me guilty  
And I won't disagree,  
For I knew that it would happen  
If I wasn't put away.  
  
And I'm glad I've had no parents  
To care for me or cry,  
For now they will never know  
The horrible death I die.  
And I'm also glad I've had no friends  
To see me in disgrace,  
For they'll never see that hangman's hood  
Wrap around my face.  
  
Farewell unto the old north woods  
Of which I used to roam,  
Farewell unto the crowded bars  
Of which've been my home,  
Farewell to all you people  
Who think the worst of me,  
I guess you'll feel much better when  
I'm on that hanging tree.  
  
But there's just one question  
Before they kill me dead,  
I'm wondering just how much  
To you I really said  
Concerning all the boys that come  
Down a road like me,  
Are they enemies or victims  
Of your society?

Oh can't you see  
You're the last love for me  
  
And if I ever really hurt you  
How sorry I would be  
There's something I've been trying to tell you  
Darlin' it's time you know  
You'll always be a part of me

0,"When I was a young boy,  
My mama said to me  
Your daddy's leavin' home today,  
I think he's gone to stay.  
We packed up all our bags  
And drove out to Winnipeg.  
  
When we got to Winnipeg  
I checked in to school.  
I wore white bucks on my feet,  
When I learned the golden rule.  
The punches came fast and hard  
Lying on my back in the school yard.  
  
Don't be denied, don't be denied.  
Don't be denied, don't be denied.  
Don't be denied, don't be denied.  
  
Well pretty soon I met a friend,  
He played guitar.  
We used to sit on the steps at school  
And dream of being stars.  
We started a band,  
We played all night.  
  
Don't be denied, don't be denied.  
Don't be denied, don't be denied.  
Don't be denied, don't be denied.  
  
Oh Canada  
We played all night  
I really hate to leave you now  
But to stay just wouldn't be right.  
Down in Hollywood  
We played so good  
  
The businessmen crowded around  
They came to hear the golden sound  
There we were on the Sunset Strip,  
Playing our songs for the highest bid.  
We played all night  
The price was right.  
  
Don't be denied, don't be denied.  
Don't be denied, don't be denied.  
Don't be denied, don't be denied.  
  
Well, all that glitters isn't gold  
I know you've heard that story told.  
And I'm a pauper in a naked disguise  
A millionaire through a business man's eyes.  
Oh friend of mine  
Don't be denied.

Baby come and talk to me  
Let me know what's on your mind  
Every time I see you  
You're running from me all the time  
  
Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you  
I only wanted you to be happy  
You to have the best of things  
To be down with me, baby  
'cause your lovin', it's so good  
  
You're giving me the run-around  
Thought our love was going down  
Baby don't you know  
That I'm down until the day I die  
Baby hear me, never meant to hurt you  
Now you know i'll never do anything to hurt you  
'cause baby I love you  
  
Every night and day I pray  
Your love returns  
Oh I'd give my life  
If it would only make you happy

Sittin' reminiscin' on when you started dissin'  
Spittin' in faces in public places  
Rolexes with faces had you chipper for months  
Made some dough, did some shows, now you're starting to front  
Smokin' blunts on the veranda with amanda  
She's fillin' your head with he said, she said  
Poppa doin' this, poppa doin' that  
But don't tell him I said it 'cause my jeep might get wetted  
Forget it, go on take her word like the koran  
Ya'll stay friends, i'll stay and smoke phil benzs  
Honeysuckle sets, biggie secret pyjama sets  
You were the reebok vandal, now you were chanel sandals  
I made you - why would I play you?  
Think about it while the streets you roam  
It's all peas and crispies in the fridge when you get home  
  
Chorus  
You to be, be happy  
You to have the best of things  
Baby everything you want it for baby  
You to be down with me  
So give me that ass back baby  
'cause your lovin' is so good, so damn good, babe  
  
Everyday and night I pray love will swing you back this way  
Life without you here with me ain't the same without you g

Why I'm so in love and why I love you so  
Couldn't tell you though I tried dear  
Just why dear I'm yours  
When you went away you left a glowing spark  
Trying to be gay is whistling in the dark  
I am only what you make me  
Come take me, I'm yours how happy  
I would be to beg or borrow or sorrow with you  
Even though I knew tomorrow you'd say we were through  
If we drift apart then I'll be lost alone  
Though you used my heart just for a stepping stone  
How can I help dreaming of you  
I love you I'm yours  
If we drift apart then I'll be left alone  
Though you used my heart just for a stepping stone  
How can I help dreaming of you  
I love you I'm yours

Never knew what they had done  
Some girls always wasted time  
Keep you hanging on the line  
Some loved horses and always stayed at home  
But a Stainsby girl loved the Rolling Stones  
  
Now some had games that you had to play  
Making rules along the way  
Strange attractions newly found  
Pride and passion kicked around  
Some girl stole your heart  
Like most girls do  
But a Stainsby girl, she could break it in two  
  
And I fell in love, I fell in love  
I fell in love with a Stainsby girl  
  
Deepest water Stainsby blue  
Running straight, and running true  
Names and faces fade away  
Memory here to stay  
  
Some girls steal your heart  
Most still do,  
But a Stainsby girl, she could break it in two  
  
I fell in love, I fell in love  
I fell in love with a Stainsby girl

And has been on his hit list for a minute and I think he's ready to handle his

Night of your life, life, life  
Night of your life, life, life  
  
I could have ya, if I wanted to  
Down on one knee, in front of me where them bells ringing  
I could claim ya, be your savior  
Wrap your heart inside of these arms and you'll never leave  
I could have your hands tied, round my body all up on me  
Boy you'll be stuck to me, if I wanted with no release  
I'll have you begging, wishing now I give you a piece  
Baby you'll never be the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Taller than a mountain, deeper than the sea  
You're boiling hot for me babe, one hundred degrees  
I want you to love me like your favorite dream  
Let's make tonight a reality  
  
So now love me, baby treat me right  
And we'll be riding it from morning til midnight  
If you love me til the end of time  
Then I will promise you the night of your life  
Night of your life, life, life  
Night of your life, life, life  
Night of your life, life, life

Then I'm really not so sure  
When side of the bed I should lay,

To tell your troubles to,

Shooting verbal missiles, find their target right on sight, right on sight

Dreaming of a battlefield with guns and ammunition  
All around, the bodies of the wounded and the dead, and the dead

Hardly spoke to folks around him didn't have too much to say  
No one dared to ask his business no one dared to make a slip  
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip  
Big iron on his hip  
  
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town  
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around  
He's an outlaw loose and running came the whisper from each lip  
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip  
Big iron on his hip  
  
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red  
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead  
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty four  
And the notches on his pistol numbered one an nineteen more  
One and nineteen more  
  
Now the stranger started talking made it plain to folks around  
Was an Arizona ranger wouldn't be too long in town  
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead  
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red  
After Texas Red  
  
Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red  
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead  
Twenty men had tried to take twenty men had made a slip  
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip  
Big iron on his hip  
  
The morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet  
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street  
Folks were watching from their windows every-body held their breath  
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death  
About to meet his death  
  
There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play  
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about to-day  
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped  
And the rangers aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip  
Big iron on his hip  
  
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round  
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground  
Oh he might have gone on living but he made one fatal slip  
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip  
Big iron on his hip  
  
Big iron Big iron  
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip The Big Iron on

I want it all or nothin' at all  
Said you'd take me for a little dance  
If you had a little time on your hands  
Well all I do is push and shove  
Just to get a little piece of your love  
I want it all or nothin' at all  
I want it all or nothin' at all  
Well now I don't want to be greedy  
But when it comes to love there ain't no doubt  
You just ain't gonna get what you want  
With one foot in and one foot out  
You got to give it all or nothin' at all  
All or nothin' at all  
Now I only got a little time  
So if you're gonna change your mind  
Then shout out what you're thinking of  
If what you're thinkin' of is love  
I want it all or nothin' at all  
I want it all or nothin' at all

There's a grief that can't be spoken  
There's a pain goes on and on  
Empty chairs at empty tables  
Now my friends are dead and gone  
  
Here they talked of revolution  
Here it was they lit the flame  
Here they sang about tomorrow  
And tomorrow never came.  
  
From the table in the corner  
They could see a world reborn  
And they rose with voices ringing  
And I can hear them now!  
The very words that they had sung  
Became their last communion  
On the lonely barricade...  
At dawn.  
  
Oh my friends, my friends forgive me.  
  
[The ghosts of those who died on the barricade appear.]  
  
That I live and you are gone  
There's a grief that can't be spoken

Phantom shadows on the floor  
Empty chairs at empty tables  
Where my friends will meet no more.

What your sacrifice was for  
Empty chairs at empty tables  
Where my friends will sing no more...

We got nothing  
We got everything

And I flew a paper plane

But the cool, cool, cool of soul  
And I've got nothing in my pockets  
But lose change and gold zero!  
And I'm trying to get somewhere  
In a room with glow  
The church mice are singing now  
What John Lee Hooker knows  
Godhead  
We got nothing

In her mirrored room tonight

Oh yeah  
Light it up  
There's no love where  
There's no life  
Where it's dark  
And we fuss and fight  
We've gotta lighten up  
We've gotta open up  
Everybody  
Gotta light the world up  
Any man  
Ain't that bad  
Neither is  
Being sad  
We gotta let it out  
Scream and shout  
Letting go is  
What it's all about  
Well it's time to give  
Be positive  
Open up  
Then you can live  
Just check your motive  
Make sure it's positive  
In everything you do  
There must be love  
Gotta light it up  
Light that world  
Oh yeah  
Here's the score  
No more war  
Just lots of love with  
Open doors  
To a higher realm  
Where hate is sensitive  
Remember open up and  
Love one and all  
You know what I'm talkin' about  
Just gotta lighten up

Voices singin', hearts a-beatin' ah...  
  
Your always talkin' right and talkin' about  
The world and it's corruption and moral decay  
But what you gonna do about it, nothing,

Why you're so clean through and through you won't shake hands  
With a negro who's maybe cleaner then you  
Well listen around and you'll hear children laughin',  
Voices singin', hearts a-beatin' like they always do  
So what's wrong with you, ah...  
  
You're so blown up with anger about the world  
You write the songs about  
Yet you don't even know your neighbors name  
Now you want to go the the moon and live there  
When you know it'll only end up the same  
How can he give you any gratitude,  
With your endless sickenin' attitude  
You strive to get ahead  
But you leave each other dead  
Can't you see, children laughin',  
Voices singin', hearts beatin' like they always do  
So what's wrong with you, ah...

Children laughin', voices singin', (fade)

And we knew how to cry  
Yeah, we sure knew how to live  
But we don't ever  
  
Never say die  
Never say die  
  
I guess you'd say we had a pact  
These words we knew so well (that's right)  
Still they remained unspoken  
And we'd take them to the fiery  
Gates of hell  
  
Once I was afraid of love  
But when it's your brother  
Those things change  
'Cause love is just another word  
For trust  
So hear me when I say  
  
Never say die  
Never say no  
You got to look them in the eye  
And don't let go  
When it's your own blood you'll bleed  
And your own tears you'll cry  
When you're brought up to believe  
That it's the strong who survive  
Never say die  
  
Yeah, and we could run like lightning  
Through the pouring rain  
And we'll be standing like a soldier  
Who comes marching home again  
  
They ask what it is that I want written  
On the gravestone where I'll lie  
Tell them it's just my bones  
That died there  
So save the tears they'll cry  
  
My spirit is still riding somewhere  
Somewhere in this night  
When it's these three words that come to me  
As I kiss this world goodbye  
  
Never say die  
Never say no  
You got to look them in the eye  
And don't let go  
When it's your own blood you'll bleed  
And your own tears you'll cry  
When you're brought up to believe  
That it's the strong who survive  
Never say die

Effigy.

What strange and lovely harmony of such different beauties!  
How dark is Floria, this ardent love of mine.

Fills the air

Are gathering there  
When it's Christmas time

Leading the band  
To a good old Creole beat

You have given me everything I needed  
According to your riches  
And the plans set for my life  
They are for blessings not for curses  
So I'll render unto You  
All of the glory You are due

Much the Lord has  
Done for me

Lord You are faithful  
For in the time of distress  
You'll hide me in Your tabernacle  
If these would hold their peace  
Then the rocks would cry out for me

He was shining best at everything he did  
They said that he could lighten up a room with just a smile  
And I was proud as hell to be his kid  
  
It seemed like just as we were growing close together he was gone  
But it was long enough to show what I could be  
And I sometimes feel his spirit fill my body like a song  
And this is what my Daddy sings to me  
  
[Chorus]  
If they deal you down and dirty in a way you don't deserve  
You'll feel better if you take it like a man  
If you let 'em drive you crazy, boy, they'll shut your business down  
Shake it off and get your licks in when you can  
Cause the heart is all that matters in the end  
  
They say every song is sweeter when you sing it from the heart  
I won't knock it 'cause I tried it and it's true  
I may never get to heaven, but I've seen a lot of stars  
And I'm here to bring the same advice to you.

It's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you  
All I can do to keep from letting it show  
Yeah it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you  
All I can do to keep from telling you so  
I wasn't looking for love when I found you  
Just someone to be with and have a good time  
But I get these strange funny feelings around you  
When you're not with me, you're still on my mind  
And it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you  
All I can do to keep from letting it show  
Yeah it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you  
All I can do to keep from telling you so  
I had intended to wait for a long time  
I thought that love would just mess up my plans  
'Cause I had big plans for a bright shining future  
Could this be my future that's holding my hand  
And it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you  
All I can do to keep from letting it show  
Yeah it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you  
All I can do to keep from telling you so  
I need to tell you how I feel about you  
But I'm so afraid that you don't feel the same  
But if I don't tell you how I feel about you  
I just might lose you, can I take that chance  
And it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you  
All I can do to keep from letting it show  
Yeah it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you  
All I can do to keep from telling you so

0,"When I was seventeen  
It was a very good year  
It was a very good year for small town girls  
And soft summer nights  
We'd hide from the lights  
On the village green  
When I was seventeen  
  
When I was twenty-one  
It was a very good year  
It was a very good year for city girls  
Who lived up the stair  
With all that perfumed hair  
And it came undone  
When I was twenty-one  
  
When I was thirty-five  
It was a very good year  
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls  
Of independent means  
We'd ride in limousines  
And their chauffeurs would drive  
When I was thirty-five  
  
But now the days grow short  
I'm in the autumn of my years  
And I think of my life as vintage wine  
From fine old kegs  
From the brim to the dregs  
And it poured sweet and clear  
It was a very good year

Send the mantra to an endless night  
Feel the glow, feel the peace of mind  
True perfection in one true light  
  
Pathways in my mind that lead to nowhere  
Promises of happiness that leave me wanting more  
When my desire becomes a nightmare  
Feel paranoia about what I'm wishing for  
If I could just let go of who I think I am  
Surrender to the silence, help me understand  
  
There's no beginning, there's no end  
There is no self, no fortress to defend  
An endless circle beyond space and time  
It's the chain of love that binds me  
The chain of love defines me  
Chain, chain, chain, chain of love  
  
Voices in my head that try to rule me  
I've found a place where I can't hear them anymore  
My own illusions come to fool me  
Lost in emotions that I've never touched before  
If I could get beyond what's in my mind  
Free my spirit, leave the world behind  
  
There's no beginning, there's no end  
There is no self, no fortress to defend  
An endless circle beyond space and time  
It's the chain of love that binds me  
The chain of love defines me

Set upon weary feet  
Who looks in need of sleep  
That doesn't come  
This twisted, tortured mess  
This bed of sinfulness  
Who's longing for some rest  
And feeling numb  
What do you expect of me  
What is it you want?  
Whatever you've planned for me  
I'm not the one  
A vicious appetite  
Visits me each night  
And won't be satisfied  
Won't be denied  
An unbearable pain  
A beating in my brain  
That leaves the mark of Cain  
Right here inside  
What am I supposed to do?  
When everything that I've done  
Is leading me to conclude  
I'm not the one  
Whatever I've done  
I've been staring down the Barrel of a Gun  
Is there something you need from me?  
Are you having your fun?  
I never agreed to be  
Your Holy One  
Whatever I've done  
I've been staring down the Barrel of a Gun

Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs  
Killing time in the '70s  
Smelling of love through the moist winds  
Don't let me know when you're opening the door  
Close me in the dark, let me disappear  
Soon there'll be nothing left of me  
Nothing left to release

""Do not be afraid Mary  
You have found favor with god  
You will be with child  
And give birth to a son  
And you are to give him the name Jesus  
He will be great  
And will be called the son of the most high  
And the lord god will give him the throne of his father David  
And he will reign over the house of David forever  
His kingdom will never end""

Cold and weary with a babe inside  
And I wonder what I've done  
Holy father you have come  
And chosen me now to carry your son  
  
I am waiting in a silent prayer  
I am frightened by the load I bear  
In a world as cold as stone  
Must I walk this path alone  
Be with me now  
Be with me now

Hold me together  
Be forever near me

Lighten my darkness  
Pour over me your holiness  
For your are holy

Do you wonder as you watch my face  
If a wiser one should have had my place  
But I offer all I am  
For the mercy of your plan  
Help me be strong  
Help me be  
Help me

I hopped on the lap of my dear old dad  
Something jumped and poked me good  
'That' he said 'just me morning wood'  
A little tin soldier's marchin by  
Sergeant major unzips his fly  
Pulls his weapon from his camouflage pants  
Slaps away til it starts to dance  
A shootin star's above my bed  
Changin colors of my mushroom head  
A rainbow jizz flys across the room  
Little white spermies meet their doom  
(Ah!) The amazing Willy Wanker!  
(Aaaah!) The amazing Willy Wanker!  
And my scrotum sack he says  
Lalalalalala, tickle me!  
Little green men from outer space  
Here to exterminate the human race  
Drop their ray guns and retreat to their ships  
When marshmallow sauce squirts from me tip  
Like a knight of olden Camelot  
The goo takes off like an arrow shot  
Gwynevere drops to her knees and begs  
For the spittin dragon between me legs  
I'm using my thing for what it's for  
Gentle knock upon me door  
Mumsy drops her cup of tea  
When she sees my wank standing tall and free  
(Ah!) The one and only Willy Wanker!  
(Aaaaah!) Here comes Willy Wanker!  
And my marble sack he says  
Lalalalalala, tickle me!  
Rasberry scones and marmalade!  
Squeezing my squid in the evening shine!  
Visions of mermaids in the sky!  
Shooting my load in me own left eye!  
Gramps was a hero in the first World War  
But he ain't got no dick no more  
Comes home smokin from the corner pub  
Makes poor old Gramsy kiss his nub  
The world spins around like a big bass drum  
Nanny pops a pinkie in the generals bum  
The Irish dance and the Scotsmem howl  
Time to clean up with the washroom towel  
(Ah, yeah!) It's only Willy Wanker, yeah!

I wish it could be more  
But it's harder than I thought  
To find the work I came here for  
This place is just as pretty  
As I pictured it to be  
But a man in need of work's  
An all too common sight to see  
Each morning as the trucks roll in  
A lucky few climb on  
And the rest of us are left to wonder  
Where the dream has gone  
Where the dream has gone  
They say the Sierra melts with the rain  
To race through the valley like blood through the vein  
Turning the lowland from golden to green  
To harvest forever the dreams of the San Joaquin  
Every day I struggle  
With the distance and the fear  
That I will not return  
Or find a way to bring you here  
My emptiness grows deeper  
I feel my spirit fall  
As night comes like a blanket  
It brings no sleep at all  
I only hope that time will find  
A way to work things out  
We will be together  
In the life we dream about  
Life we dream about  
They say the Sierra melts with the rain  
To race through the valley like blood through the vein  
Turning the lowland from golden to green  
To harvest forever the dreams of the San Joaquin  
We'll harvest forever the dreams of the San Joaquin

To the sounds of Oran Juice Jones and

Puts hers handbag on the chair

When we were fifteen and still cared  
'Cause she feels I'm a scar from the wound  
That time can't heal  
  
And I said  
Don't let your dreams out of your head  
Stick it to the man instead  
Don't fool your heart lying about  
The feelings that you had back then  
Did you try to change your life?  
Did you ever try to change your life?  
You repeat and repeat  
And repeat and repeat  
Now what's up with that?  
  
Now she loves somebody else  
In flash clothes  
She was the girl with the acid stare  
And now she'd pay to have one of those

Where am I going  
How do I get there  
What should I bring along  
Are people kind there  
Is peace of mind there  
Will I finally belong  
  
Cause you know ships sail their courses  
And heroes ride horses  
They know where they belong  
But I travel in circles  
Quickly to nowhere  
Singing my unfinished song  
  
Some poets say that  
There'll come a day that  
I'll find a place for me  
Why aren't I there yet  
Why can't I share yet  
Why can't my heart be free  
  
Cause you know ships sail their courses  
And heroes ride horses  
They know where they belong  
But I travel in circles  
Quickly to nowhere

It really messes up your heart  
You want to stop right there  
And go right back to the start  
  
You got to leave the town you're living in  
Oh I'm leaving, I'm leaving on the next train  
My dreams have been broken  
I don't think I'll ever be the same  
  
It's a bad, bad feeling when all the things  
That you've worked for just don't seem to turn out right  
Well this happened to me last night  
I woke up this morning and said I must be going  
  
You see my dreams have been broken  
I don't think I have  
The strength to carry on  
So I'll catch the next train southbound  
  
I don't want no pity  
Not from you or anyone  
It's just my dreams been broken  
And I got to tell someone before I go crazy  
  
I'll be leaving  
I'll be leaving  
On that next train going southbound  
Yes, I'll be leaving on that next train  
  
You see my dreams been broken  
And I just can't  
Take the pain  
I've got to move on

To carry on

When you would cry  
I miss you in my life  
I miss you in my life  
I miss you in my life  
So miss you in my life  
You hide your answers within every smile  
Time and time again I'd lose my chances  
To reconcile  
Even if I had my time over  
It would take a while  
To reveal all my best intentions

And I just watched the empty road behind you  
Where the fog lies kissing the mountainside  
You want to be sleeping, deep inside  
Believing that the hungry world won't find you  
  
Well, that's just fine, that's just fine  
You've got to believe and I don't know, I don't know  
What I believe anymore  
Or whether to leave, or whether to stay  
Or what I can say  
To make you know  
How deep it goes  
  
Somebody turned on the dirty blues  
I know you don't like the blues  
Cause the words are always the same  
And they kind of remind you  
Somebody turned the blues on me  
I don't like the blues cause I can't see  
Through the tears that come and make it hard to find you  
  
Come on down  
Come on down  
You've got to come lay down here and say those things  
Those warm things, right here in my ear  
The times that you had that water like wine  
So clean and so fine to make me know how deep it goes  
Well, that's just fine, that's just fine  
You've got to believe and I don't know, I don't know  
If I could leave anymore, even though there's a scar  
Still fresh from the war, don't think about it no more  
Letting new love flow  
How deep it goes

His ex girlfriend's friend was there alone.  
She bought a couple rounds and I got the feeling, she could really handle
alcohol.  
  
Another one down and headed off the deep end.  
The more we drank, the less that we had on.  
  
And it turns out she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one.  
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo.  
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt.  
She's got a fast car, hotter than a dance bar.  
Looking like a rock star, she'll be the talk of the town.  
You know, she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one.  
Gotta get me some.  
  
God all mighty look at that body.  
Looks just like a sticker on a new Ferrari.  
She's a scene from a Baywatch rerun.  
Hotter then a barrel on a squeeze machine gun.  
  
Well, she can get it lower then a Maserati.  
Never seen somebody move that way.  
Everywhere she goes there's an instant party.  
Everybody wants to know her name.  
  
And it turns out she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one.  
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo.  
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt.  
She's got a fast car, hotter then a dance bar.  
Looking like a rock star, and she likes to go out and  
  
She likes to get her hands up.  
Anything to stand on.  
Anything to dance on.  
She'd be swinging around.  
Under the hot lights, underneath the spot light.  
Keep it going all night.  
She'll be the talk of the town.  
  
You know, she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one.

Get your cameras ready, let it rain confetti,  
I'm a champion, I do what can't be done,

Fool I'm the greatest, you just the latest,

One kiss, one single kiss  
A face outside the window pane  
However did it come to this?  
  
A man who ran, a child who cried  
A girl who heard, a voice that lied  
The sun that burned a fiery red  
The vision of an empty bed  
  
The use of force, he was so tough  
She'll soon submit, she's had enough  
The march of fate, the broken will  
Someone is lying very still  
  
He has laughed and he has cried  
He has fought and he has died  
He's just the same as all the rest  
He's not the worst, he's not the best  
  
And still this ceaseless murmuring  
The babbling that I brook  
The seas of faces, eyes upraised  
The empty screen, the vacant look  
  
A man in black on a snow white horse,  
A pointless life has run its course,  
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run  
As he fades into the setting sun  
  
You're going on that plane to take you where you belong.  
But no, I have  
You have got to listen to me.  
Do you have any idea what you have to look forward to if you stay here?  
Nine chances out of ten we both end up in a concentration camp and that  
You're only saying these things to make me go.  
I'm saying it 'cause it's true. Inside us, we both know we belong in different  
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.  
But what about us?  
But what about us?  
But what about us?

Together we were one  
No sunshine in my weary eyes

And the time that it took to take down the wall  
Was the time that it took for me to fall  
Hopelessly weak

Don't worry if they take me away  
No one can take you away from me now

Were really all the same

Endless nights out with the boys  
The boasting and the noise  
To think that I ever believed them

Afraid the mans gonna take us for all that were worth  
Strip us of our pride  
Make a strike from inside  
Come on and tell me  
How long will we be victims of fear  
With a man and a gun and the day after fear  
Jesus smile down upon your children  
Smile down upon your family  
  
Even lovers have trouble at hand  
What's your preference where do you stand  
You get all uptight about it  
Wanna fight about it  
Wanna fight about love  
No no no  
Wanting independence separate but equal  
A lover here another there  
One more for the sequel to the heartache  
How much more can we take

How long will we be victims of fear  
With a man and a gun and the day after fear  
Jesus smile down upon your children  
Smile down upon your family

Altruism and unification  
We forgotten what that means  
Cynicism in this mighty nation  
And hatred is spitting us right at the seams  
  
Oh but I still believe that good will prevail  
And if we don't ever try  
Its damn sure that well fail  
Lose another day  
The american way  
So come all believers  
Come all races  
Start looking at the souls  
Not at the faces  
And were there  
And were learning to care  
I want to know baby  
How long will we be victims of fear  
With a man and a gun and the day after fear  
Jesus smile down upon your children  
Smile down upon your family

I got the lovesick blu-ues.  
  
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal  
That's what's the matter with me  
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal  
But she don't care about me  
Lawd, I tried and I tried, to keep her satisfied  
But she just wouldn't stay  
So now that she is lea-eav-in'  
This is all I can say.

To pay the cost would never be the same  
Eternal lovers we're not to blame

The same surroundings that stood  
Are here again - this time...  
  
As I look around you can't be found  
To lose you I'd rather see  
The endless time of space go passing by  
This time around...

When you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose

She said one day her husband went to get a paper and the mother fucker never
came back  
Mortgage to pay and four kids to raise, keeping the wolf from the door  
She said the wolf's just a puppy and the door's double locked so why you
gottaworry me for  
Now he left a hole in my heart a hole in a promise a hole on the side of my
bed  
Oh but now that he's gone well life carries on and I miss him like a hole in

0,"Losers - losers - losers - losers  
  
The moment I saw your face  
Your eyes swept me away  
The moment I heard your voice  
I knew we'd touch someday  
But we're losers in love  
Afraid of what we feel  
Please don't turn away  
Just because I'm beeing real  
'Cause I've been through this before  
And I don't want to be a loser in love  
  
Loser - loser  
I don't want to be  
Loser - loser  
  
I know it's not my time so I'll be on my way  
I'll never forget your smile  
And I won't forget this day  
'Cause we're losers in love  
In a time of empty dreams  
Just two losers in love  
Afraid of what we feel  
Please don't turn me away  
'Cause I don't want to be losers in love

They're down on their knees

Let the people speak

I got to tell you  
Yeah you got to have faith  
In each other  
All you ever  
All you ever have for each other  
  
They give us a reason  
To go on living  
It's all in the choices  
That you have to make  
I got to tell you  
You better make them good

Tattle tale rights  
They'll take your back and leave your shirt  
Like that jealous bitch  
Always wanting more  
The courts have made her rich  
And the click of high heels down the corridor  
Jealous, jealous, jealous dogs  
  
Those jealous dogs, detectives every one  
Don't be a sucker all your life  
She's gonna have you hung  
Evidence, evidence, evidence  
Suspicion invites treachery  
Oh you really got taken  
Bringing home the bacon  
Jealous, jealous, jealous dogs  
  
Bow wow wow, here come the dogs  
Grrrrrr, here come the dogs  
Don't lay down, here come the dogs  
Stand straight don't slouch  
Get down off the couch  
  
You're gonna wet on the couch  
Get down, get down  
  
Those jealous dogs, they get worse and worse  
Every time you turn around  
They're sniffin' at your purse  
Who do they think we are?  
What do they think we do?  
It's hard to get in the mood  
When you're treated like some kind of dog food  
Jealous, jealous, jealous dogs  
  
Bow wow wow, here come the dogs  
Oh ruff ruff, here come the dogs  
Get down, here come the dogs  
Mind your leg, roll over and beg  
  
Happy birthday  
Merry Christmas

Oh but what i wouldn't give  
For a ray of sun and a little piece of beach  
Where the sand dollar is the only currency  
  
[Chorus:]  
I vote we go to the gulf of mexico  
You and me by the sea  
Palm trees call me, oh that's the place i want to be  
Down where the southern breezes blow  
On the Gulf of Mexico  
  
Right at five o'clock today  
I'll pick you up, we'll drive away  
And i can't wait to feel the sand beneath my toes  
And i can almost see the sunburn on your nose

Vamos we go... (repeat chorus again)

Why did I tell you I was goin' to Shanghai  
I want to be with you tonight  
Why did I holler I was goin' to Shanghai  
I want to be with you tonight  
It was just a little misunderstanding  
That a kiss on the cheek could patch  
I need you so badly  
I'd gladly start all over from scratch  
  
Oh, why did I tell you it was bye-bye for Shanghai  
I'm even allergic to rice  
Why don't you stop me when I talk about Shanghai  
It's just a lover's device

0,"He came riding in on a sunrise  
A hot west Texas day  
A fancy man in a painted wagon  
Some fancy things to say  
Looks like you folks'll need some water  
Well water is my game  
For the small price of a hundred dollars  
I bet you I can make it rain  
So get away all non-believers or the rain'll never come  
Someone start a fire burning, somebody beat the drum  
Some may think I'm crazy for making all these claims  
But I swear before the day is over your folks'll see some rain  
They all just stood a staring trying to believe  
But there was one named Lizzy Cooper said he was a lying cheat  
She said you call yourself a rainman, well you oughta be ashamed  
For starting all these people dreaming thinking you can make it rain  
So get away all non-believers or the rain'll never come  
Someone keep the fire burning, somebody beat the drum  
Some may think I'm crazy for making all these claims  
But I swear before the day is over your folks'll see some rain  
Oh Lizzy, a man's gotta have a dream  
And if you can walk on the inside with me  
I'll meet you in between  
Come with me Lizzy  
And the stars'll write your name  
And if you still think I'm lying to you  
Look yonder here comes the rain  
So get away all non-believers or the rain'll never come  
Someone keep the fire burning, somebody beat the drum  
Some may think I'm crazy for making all these claims  
But I swear before the day is over your folks'll see some rain  
So get away all non-believers or the rain'll never come  
Someone keep the fire burning, somebody beat the drum

That's that crack music nigga  
That real black music nigga  
(That's that crack music nigga)  
(That real black music nigga)  
  
How we stop the black panthers?  
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer  
You hear that?  
What Gil Scott was hearing  
When our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin  
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland  
We invested in that it's like we got Merril-Lynch  
And we been hanging from the same tree ever since  
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine  
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it  
The fiends cop it  
Nowadays they can't tell if that's that good shit  
We ain't sure man  
Put the CD on your tongue yeah, that's pure man

From the place where the fathers gone  
The mothers is hardly home  
And the  
Gonna lock us up in a, home  
How the Mexicans say we just trying to party homes  
They want to pack us all in a box like Styrofoam  
Who gave Saddam anthrax?  
George Bush got the answers  
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical  
Am and Hammer baking soda  
Raised they own quota  
Writing when our soldiers ran for the stove 'cause  
'Cause dreams of being 'Hova went from being a brokeman to a being a dopeman  
Ta being a president look there's hope man  
This that inspiration for the mos and the folks man  
Shorty come and see if mama straight overdosing  
And this is the soundtrack  
This the type of music you make when you round that  
Crack music nigga

Our father, give us this day our daily bread, give us these days and take our
daily bread  
See I done did all this ole bullshit  
And to atone I throw a little something, something on the pulpit  
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit  
And what we gave back was crack music  
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies  
So our mammas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies  
And we gonna repo everything they ever took from Grammy  
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammy's  
This dark dixon has become America's addiction those who ain't even black use

0,"Wishful thinking, eyes are blinking,  
In the sun the garbage stinking.  
To ignore the rancid, won't make it go away.  
  
Untruth spoke through blistered lip,  
Unclean thoughts that take the step,  
Down upon the roaches,  
Won't go away.  
  
Born! to follow!  
To be the first to swallow,  
Garbage from the plate.  
Now! to borrow!  
A match, ignite the gasoline,  
To burn away.  
  
Surviving through a gasoline dream,  
In the month the razon blade gleam,  
Slashing up the tongue, won't make it go away.  
On a binge of self destruction,  
  
Children of the reconstruction,  
Suck the tit of discontent,  
Go away.  
  
Slam! slam down!  
Respond in kind malcontent,  
Don't go away.  
Burn! burn down!  
  
Temple of the conscience,  
Don't go away.  
  
I was soaked in gasoline,  
Playin' with a match.  
I was everything I seemed,  
They stood and watched.  
  
Ate from your table!  
Ate from your hand!  
Eight days of waiting!  
Buried in the sand!  
  
Burn in a gasoline dream, burn away my love.  
Burn away the conscience, burn away, my love.  
Take away my dignity, take away my pain,  
Take just for taking, we are one in the same...  
  
Burn... Burn...  
Burn in a gasoline dream, burn away my love.  
Burn away the conscience, burn away, my love.

Gonna be so happy living life alone  
And never sharing anything  
  
Thought that I was finished,  
Thought that I was complete  
Thought that I was whole  
Instead of being half of something  
  
Thought that I was growing, growing older  
Wiser, understanding why  
This world hold nothing for my spirit  
Thought that I was destined,  
  
Destined to be nothing,  
Destined to be nothing in this world  
And then I met you.  
  
I met you  
  
Thought that God had failed me  
Thought my prayers were useless  
Thought that he would never give  
The chance for me to praise him  
  
Thought the book was written  
Thought the game had ended  
Thought the song was sung  
And I could never sing another  
  
Thought my faith was misplaced  
Thought my back was broken  
  
Broken by a weight that I  
Was never fit to carry  
Thought I knew this city,  
Thought I knew all about it  
And then one night I went to Morningside  
And you were waiting  
Then I met you.

Well, it's a long way from Star, Mississippi  
To the big stage I'm singing on tonight  
And sometimes the butterflies still get me  
When I'm in the spotlight  
  
And some people seem to think that I've changed  
That I'm different than I was back then  
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way  
That I've really always been

'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways  
Just 'cause everybody knows her name  
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame  
I still like wearing my old ball cap  
Riding my kids around piggy back  
They might know me all around the world  
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl  
  
Woo!  
  
Well, I spent a few weeks in California  
They put my face on the big movie screen  
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from  
That's just me chasing dreams  
  
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways  
Just 'cause everybody knows her name  
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame

And no one knows the gypsy's name,  
And no one hears his lonely sighs,  
There are no blankets where he lies.  
Lord, in his deepest dreams the gypsy flies,  
With sweet Melissa.  
Mmmm-hmmm.  
  
Again, the mornin's come.  
Again, he's on the run.  
A sunbeam's shinin through his hair.  
Appearing not to have a care.  
Well, pick up your gear and gypsy roll on.  
Roll on.  
  
Crossroads, will you ever let him go? Lord, Lord.  
Or will you hide the dead man's ghost?  
Or will he lie, beneath the clay?  
Or will his spirit float away?  
But, I know that he won't stay,  
Without Melissa.  
Yes, I know that he won't stay, yeah,  
Without Melissa.  
Lord, Lord, it's all the same.  
Mmmmm-hmmmmm.

Half-a-mile past the slingshot tree  
Wanders round through a million memories  
It's callin' me, callin' me  
  
There's a white house with fading shutters  
The old front door that never needed a key  
And I hear my Mama in the hush of the evenin'  
Callin' me, yeah, she's callin' me

It reminds me of where I'm from

Filled with voices singin' harmony

Just four people that 's all we were  
Tryin' to make a livin' out of black-land dirt  
But we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud  
  
Daddy sang bass (mama sang tenor)  
Me and little brother would join right in there  
Singin' seems to help a troubled soul  
One of these days and it won't be long  
I'll rejoin them in a song  
I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne

You could hear us singin' for a country mile  
Now little brother has done gone on  
But I'll rejoin him in a song  
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while

New York City to the Golden Gate  
I've lived with some, and buddy, I loved 'em all. (Yes, I did)  
But no one woman had a claim on me  
'Cause I still had a lotta world to see  
And I sometimes stagger, but sugar, I seldom fall.  
Then like a hungry man, I went to Louisiana  
Where the lovin' and the livin' was good  
Without a care to hide and just as satisfied as I could be.  
A lotta women and wine and not a tie to bind me  
And behaving just as cool as I could  
'Til that long legged, sweet walkin' ravenhaired cajun lookin'  
Devil put the sweat on me  
They call her Smokey, she's a little bit-a evil  
Smokey, right as wrong can be.  
Smokey, she could shake the very devil  
Smokey put the sweat on me.  
Oh, my pulse is a beatin' to the clickety clack  
Of this one-way ride that's gonna take me back  
And my body's just a-breathin' in that Mississippi River smell  
Well, my feet wasn't ready yet for settling down  
But my soul kept tellin' me to turn around  
And the longer I tried to fight it, the harder I fell  
And like a hungry man, I went to Louisiana  
Where the lovin' and the livin' is good  
I'll get a brand new bride and be as satisfied as I can be  
And I won't even mind the world I'm leavin' behind  
Because I never really thought that I could  
'Til that long legged, sweet walkin' ravenhaired cajun looking devil  
Put the sweat on me.

Keeping an eye on the Holy Land.  
A hypothetical destination, say,  
Who is this walking man?  
Well, the leaves have come to turning  
And the goose has gone to fly,  
And bridges are for burning,  
So don't you let that yearning pass you by.

But the walking man walks.  
Well the frost is on the pumpkin  
And the hay is in the barn.  
Pappy's come to rambling on,  
Stumbling around drunk down on the farm.

Ah, but who would want to listen  
To you kissing his existence good night?  
Walking man walk.  
Walk on by my door.  
Well, any other man stops and talks  
But not the walking man.  
He's the walking man, born to walk,  
Walk on walking man.  
  
Well now, would he have wings to fly?  
Would he be free?  
Golden wings against the sky,  
Walking man, walk on by.  
So long, walking man.

Came this monster called 'A-dre-no-leu-ko-dys-tro-phy'  
Where's my East Africa?

They said from now on for you there will be no more standing tall,

Don't know what I do without it  
Without this love that we call ours  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing but the moon and stars  
  
Down every street there's a window  
And every window made of glass  
We'll keep on loving pretty baby  
For as long as love will last  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
But the mountains of the past  
  
Well my ship is in the harbor  
And the sails are spread  
Listen to me, pretty baby  
Lay your hand upon my head  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing done and nothing said

Well it's just a simple fact I  
Need to lose you as a ball and chain and move on

Now you're one less headache left at home  
And now all that's left is  
Shattered glass and some broken dreams for all  
It really doesn't matter at all  
Now that it's all said and done I  
Had to have another drink for you and move on

0,"I was born again a little north of Disney Land  
Somewhere under Wonderland and Hollywood  
But then I had to go skipping and diving and bouncing back to New York City  
Straight through the heart of America where all the wild things grow  
  
I want to be an earthquake driver  
I want to be an aquarium diver  
I just don't want to go home  
  
I mean, I live alone but I am hungry for affection  
I just struggle with connection til the water calls me home  
Down into ocean among millions of other lonely people  
Drowning among the only people we are ever going to know  
  
I want to be an earthquake driver  
I want to be an aquarium diver  
I just don't want to go home  
  
I want to be like the people I see  
They run all over just like me  
I was saved but what keeps me awake  
Is I'm tied into the lightning line  
And I wanna be where the sun is shining  
All night just a waste of time I, I don't want to see people like me  
Just sleeping in, waking in, hoping in, hating in  
  
You look at me like I'm some kind of carnival attraction  
You say love's this abstraction, just some ghost that you chase  
Well, I am sorry friend, I am a blank space  
But the words you remember from whenever you saw my face  
  
I want to be an earthquake driver  
I don't want to be an aquarium diver  
I just don't want to go home  
  
I want to be like the people I see  
Hey man, they run all over just like me  
I want to thank for what keeps me awake  
This unplugged ears to the lightning lining  
I want to see if the sun is shining  
All night, chasing time I, I don't want to be with people like me  
Just creeping in, waking in, hoping in, hating in  
  
So what is the point of this famous self absorption?  
We turn ourselves into orphans and then spend out nights alone  
Living in fear of some kind of imaginary consequence  
Terror incognito, ob-la-di ob-la-da  
  
I want to be an earthquake driver  
I don't want to be an aquarium diver  
I just don't want to go home  
  
Truth is I don't want to be no earthquake driver  
And I don't want to be an aquarium diver  
I just don't want to go home  
  
Oh man, just don't want to go home  
No, I do not want to go home

Lyrics by bernie taupin  
Available on the album breaking hearts  
  
They used to say that boys are tough as nails  
In every way he keeps his heart as guarded as a jail  
Now things have changed, I feel so old  
Like any girl could drag my heart across the coals  
  
I was always there in the thick of things  
I always had the heart of every woman on a string  
The danger zone shone from my eyes  
It seemed like every inch I gained became a mile  
  
It's not the night reaching in and touching me  
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be  
It seems that time has killed that cruel streak in me  
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be  
  
It's not the light shining in and catching me  
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be  
But time has come and cast a spell on me  
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be  
  
And now I know what lonely means  
I used to give so little and gain everything  
The darkest part of every day  
Is the shadow of another girl as she turns and walks away  
  
Can't say I blame them all for being hurt  
After all I treated each and every one like dirt  
Who wants a heart that's never home  
I face the facts and lock myself into a life alone

"
0,"Spare a thought for the souls  
Who cannot leave this earth  
The attachments bind so tightly, not a chance  
Not a chance of a new birth  
The river gently beckons  
But the answer is no  
Gripping their illusions  
They cannot let them go  
Hunger for the flesh  
Leads them to a weaker heart  
Mortals who imprisoned themselves  
Let them have a new start  
Wishing to hold onto life and all it's games  
Singing their lament song  
Holding back the change  
They came here for to dance  
To learn and not to cling  
Holding onto life  
As if it were the important thing  
Hunger for the flesh  
Hunger for security  
Caught up in the mesh  
Caught up for eternity  
Hunger for the flesh  
Hunger for security  
Caught up in the mesh  
Caught up for eternity  
The river gently beckons  
But the answer is no  
Gripping their illusions  
They cannot let them go  
Hunger for the flesh  
Leads them to a weaker heart  
Mortals who imprison themselves  
Let them have a new start  
Let them have a new start

Hunger for security  
Caught up in the mesh  
Caught up for eternity  
Hunger for the flesh  
Hunger for security  
Caught up in the mesh

Banging on locked doors,

Will cause the world to grieve,

Standing undivided

Your little, baby girl became that rose  
The bloom, the bloom blushed deeper red  
With every drop of sacrifice you bled

There's no growing without any pain  
There's no flowers without the rain  
We are bound together by blood that's flowing through us  
And that's the way it is with love  
I have a vision, a hope and a dream  
I see a hill, across a healing stream  
Where the Rose arose, to set us free  
And the Cross became a family tree

Circle of God comes around  
And turns us into special things, somehow  
And one day we'll hold little flowers of our own  
And we'll sacrifice so that they can grow

Until along came you  
To teach me about love  
Oh yes, along came you  
To teach me about love  
  
And as this feeling grows with every day  
You awaken my heart  
A heart so full I fear that it may break  
If we're ever apart  
And though one day you'll be own your own  
You know I always will be near you  
As near as on the day you were born  
Call on me, you know I'll hear you

For one reason, I can tell you  
You're here to show me what love can be

I remember takin 3, 4 trains to re cocaine  
Standing in the lobby during sleet, snow, rain  
Waiting for fiends with a pint of beef lomain  
  
Breaking day on the grind, I used to be so drained  
But ain't a Saturday I wasn't up to see Soul Train  
Sometimes I ain't see no gain  
'Cause I was runnin to Ralphies everytime my trees showed stains  
  
I was lucky I ain't seized or maim  
Get shot or stuck up standin at them see-Lo games  
But now shit with these skios changed  
I ain't know why the fuck they used to look at me so strange  
  
Glanced at my neck and didn't see no chain  
Be saying ""That's nasty"", wouldn't give me no brain  
Ya'll surprised F-A-be -O's sane  
In my rolla life, I done jumped in and out of 3, 4 lanes  
I'm still here

""Son, you're gonna make it one day, it'll happen""

To be famous and one day I'd be rappin - no

'Cause one day it could happen""  
I dreamed about this game,  
But who would of believed that one day I'd be trapped in - no  
  
I just want some peace of mind  
Nigga's will risk havin cuffs on their wrists for this masterpiece on mine  
Know that I'm a squeeze until the top of my piece recline  
I can't see myself in back of a Caprice confined  
  
But on a small island, too far for police to find  
With girls who look 'Rican and Guyanese combined  
I gotta make sure my niece is fine  
She get every doll for Christmas, new Jordans at Easter-Time  
  
Some be like ""At least you signed""  
But that just make is easy to get pointed out at precinct lines  
All ya'll can see if every piece be dime  
And I be gettin Nikes before they even get released sometime  
  
Youngsters, don't let these videos geese your mind  
It ain't cool to end up deceased for shine  
And if you can't get the whole pot, just take a piece and grind  
Hold your head, your stress will cease in time

Sometimes I wish I could go way back when  
I could walk through and ain't nobody know Jay Jackson  
Everything was OK back then  
Now everybody playin a cool role and I know they actin  
  
I gotta go back through my ol' way packin  
These wolves know my jewels is filled with O shade Jacksons  
I don't care as long as my dough stay stackin  
But these niggas with me be eager to show they Mack 10s  
  
And I'm the one the PO's stay trackin  
Plus I got all these ducks around the ol' way quackin  
These hoes may crack grins  
But I swear to God I won't never take O.J's actions  
  
If I would've let this flow stay packed in

There ain't a man in town who wouldn't  
Have her for his daughter

One taste of her toilet water

They're all trying hard to call her up  
  
But her phone's been disconnected  
Since she sold her butt

She left me blue and broken hearted I've got them old Hawaii blues  
(Your big blue eyes and darkbrown curls dear made skies of grey turn into blue  
But now you've gone and lost forever I've got them old Hawaii blues)  
You left me down where drowsy waters roll on the shores of paradise  
You've had your way dear and we have parted for you old pal I dream tonight  
Perhaps some day your mind will wander back to the one who loves you true  
And I will still for you be waiting I've got them old Hawaii blues

So safe in the blinding light of love unchained in yesterday's grave  
  
The truth that could set souls free  
Is buried within sweet pandemonium  
Concealed by disbelief  
The riddle stays veiled in sweet pandemonium  
  
Afraid that everything remains unchanged in this fragile dream  
Ashamed of the shattered remains of promises made  
  
Drained by the anger and grief  
Fazed by the envy and greed  
The secret cries for a release  
The lucidity hidden deep in sweet pandemonium

Through the darkness we reach  
As the hunger calls  
Then you run  
To the passion that takes you over  
  
No lookin' back  
The chance will never come again  
You risk it all  
For your dream  
Won't let you go  
  
When you feel the hunger  
Drivin' you on  
To your one desire  
Alone through an endless night  
And the need's never satisfied  
  
Through these eyes  
Seen a river of tears  
Seen the strong survive  
Separate lives  
And the emptiness makes you wonder  
Blame it on love  
  
You had it all and it's not enough  
You'll never change  
A slave to the fire  
It never ends  
  
Still you've got the hunger  
Drivin' you on  
To your one desire  
Never deny your heart  
  
The need to be satisfied  
Still you feel the hunger  
The primitive right  
Of a restless breed  
Surrendering all your life  
To the true nature of the beast  
  
No looking back  
The chance will never come again  
You give it all to your dream  
It never ends

Same old walls closing in

Won't you talk to me

Get up and start what needs to be done  
It's winding down, there's much you missed  
Working on that graveyard shift  
  
Well, I'm not saying there's nothing wrong as the day comes along  
If what I see is true I could learn to believe  
Can't look away  
The powers that be might take it all away  
Together we burn, together we burn away  
  
Some say a land of paradise  
Some say a land of pain  
Well, which side are you looking from  
Some people have it all  
Some all to gain  
  
Well a man in a tie gonna break his twenty dollar bill  
There's plenty of reasons in this world  
We're no longer standing still  
  
But I'm not saying there's nothing wrong as the day comes along  
If what I see is true I could learn to believe  
Can't look away

Well I can summon up my courage. Take on the whole world. Turn around and
break down just like a little girl. And I come out swingin' when my back's
against the wall.  
  
And my Mama always told me better walk before you crawl. I need a man who can
love all the women I am.  
  
I'm a mother of lost causes. A sister of the road. I give my heart to a song,
but I never sell my soul. I'm good at keeping it together when the edges start
to fray.  
  
When I'm sewing up the loose ends of everyday. I need a man who can love all
the women I am.  
  
Sometimes I'm hard to handle. Burn hotter than a candle, but I melt in the
right hands. Boy you love without condition. It ain't always easy livin' with
all the women I am.  
  
I'm a daughter of the red dirt, Okie dust still in my bones. But I can light
up New York City with my red hair and rhinestones. I'll still be my Mama's
baby when my babies fly away. My moods change like the weather, but my faith
it stays the same.  
  
I need a man who can stand all the women I am. I need a man who can love all
the women I am.  
  
Sometimes I'm hard to handle. Burn hotter than a candle, but I melt in the
right hands. Boy you love without condition. It ain't always easy livin' with
all the women I am.  
  
Hey I'm a realist. I'm a dreamer. I'm a silver linin' seeker. I'm a devil or
an angel who come running when you need her.  
  
Cause I need a man who can love all the women I am. Ohh I want a man who can
love all the women I am. Hey you're a man who can love all the women I am.
You're the man I needed all along. You can handle me baby. All the women I am.
Yeah you're the man. All the women I am.

But somehow she knew all along  
That we could never find an answer

Saying goodbye is such a chore

How can I leave it all behind  
  
And how could she throw love away

To all tomorrow's parties  
A hand-me-down dress from who knows where  
To all tomorrow's parties  
  
And where will she go and what shall she do  
When midnight comes around  
She'll turn once more to Sunday's gown  
And cry behind the door  
  
And what costume shall the poor girl wear  
To all tomorrow's parties  
Why silks and plumes of yesterday's gowns  
To all tomorrow's parties  
  
And what shall she do with Thursday's rags  
When Monday comes around  
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown  
And cry behind the door  
  
And what costume shall the poor girl wear  
To all tomorrow's parties  
For Thursday's child is Sunday's clown  
For whom none will go mourning  
  
A blackened shroud, a hand-me-down gown  
Of rags and silks, a costume  
Fit for one who sits and cries  
For all tomorrow's parties

I'm pretty sure it was him  
And he spoke so softly in accordance  
With the growing of the dim  
He said, ""Bring on the brand new renaissance  
Cause I think I'm ready  
I've been shaking all night long  
But my hands are steady.""  
  
Three pistols came and three people went, on their way  
Three pistols strong and three people spent  
  
Well he found his little lonely love  
His bride of the northern woods  
But, she took me to the Opera House  
Like she said she would  
Then she sighed and she fell from the balcony  
Shakespeare bent to touch  
She never had any time for me  
Cause I didn't protest enough  
  
Three pistols came and three people went, on their way  
Two pistols strong and three people spent  
  
Little girls come on remembrance day  
Placing flowers on his grave  
She waits in the shadows 'til after dark  
To sweep them all away  
  
I say, bring on the brand new renaissance  
Cause I think I'm ready  
I've been shaking all night long  
But my hands are steady

Three pistols strong and three people spent  
Three pistols came and three people went on their way

Hey! Hey! Do that Hebrew thing!

He'll always shlep on down for a wedding or a briss

The sweetness of your tears make it feel like night.  
I see no escape from the roles we always play  
What do we have to prove on this judgement day

Don't throw away your life-- The games not over yet  
I do not own your soul--don't want you in a cage

She is in every magazine  
Been photographed, seen, she is known

But she won't always answer the phone

It's best that we both stop fooling ourselves

There is no one, no one at all  
Never has been, and never will be a lover, male or female  
Who hasn't an eye on, in fact they rely on  
Tricks they can try on their partner  
They're hoping their lover will help them or keep them  
Support them, promote them  
Don't blame them, you're the same  
  
(Che:)  
Goodnight and thank you Emilio  
You've completed your task  
What more can we ask of you now?  
Please sign the book on the way out the door  
And that will be all, if she needs you she'll call  
But I don't think that's likely somehow

No detergent, lotion, or oil with such power in the shower

One little frolic with new Zaz carbolic  
You're scented, you'll be sent

Goodnight and thank you Senor Jabon  
We are grateful you found her a spot on the sound radio  
We'll think of you every time she's on the air  
We'd love you to stay but you'd be in the way  
So do up your trousers and go

Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies  
The decline into silence and doubt  
Our passion was just too intense to survive  
  
(Che:)  
Which means ...  
  
(Lovers:)  
This is a club I should never have joined  
Someone has made us look fools  
Argentine men call the sexual shots  
Someone has altered the rules

Oh, don't you want to find?  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
The times, the highs, breaking up your mind  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
  
Oh, you're too afraid to touch  
Too afraid you'll like it too much  
The roads, the times, breaking up your mind  
Can't you hear this beauty in life?  
  
One day maybe I will dance again  
One day maybe I will love again  
One day maybe we will dance again  
You know you've gotta  
Tie yourself to the mast my friend

One day maybe you will love again

I had a banshee on my back  
We're down in corpus christie now  
Picking up the slack  
Now I was wondering where the wild boys  
Had started off and gone  
This memories jamming buttons  
Stuck on some old song  
And if you get this message  
Leave a sign or make a call  
Mohammed's left his calling card  
And it's written on the wall  
Looking for the wild one, wild one  
Looking for the wild one,  
Looking for the wild one,  
Looking for the wild one  
She was gone in twenty seconds  
Right before my eyes  
No more honey kisses  
No more long goodbyes  
And I feel like pink nevada  
Or cooler shade of blue  
Mother earth is closer now  
Walk me out in the morning dew  
And if you get this message  
Leave a sign or make a call  
Mohammed's left his calling card  
And it's written on the wall  
Looking for the wild one, wild one  
Looking for the wild one,  
Looking for the wild one,  
Looking for the wild one  
Looking for the  
Solo  
Sometimes I stop breathing  
Just to feel reborn  
And it's like rolling thunder  
Blowing through the corn  
Through my back pages  
I can see the change  
There's a storm a coming now  
Coming through the rain  
Solo  
and I'm out here drifitng  
A million miles alone  
Floating in a spaceship somewhere  
Falling like a stone,  
Falling like a stone  
Still looking for the wild one,  
Yeah yeah

From stress, 24 tracks inside my brain  
Tyrin to maintain  
I bang shit without no gang or jherri curls  
I seem like Kadeem  
In a whole different world  
It's the girls the cars niggas lose themselves  
Forgettin who they are  
When they try to be that superstar  
They don't understand  
It's all in the game plan

Add to the ashes, then pick up the dust

And bitch niggas can't stand it  
Try to play the back and look intense  
You need to hit a fence  
You don't want none of this  
Hands on experience

Maintain and drop rappers out the frame

Well I work the double shift  
In a bookstore on St. Clair  
While he pushed the burning ingots  
In Dofasco stinking air  
Where the truth bites and stings  
I remember just what we were  
As the noon bell rings for  
Blackhawk and the white winged dove  
Hold on to your aching heart  
I'll wipe the liquor from your lips  
A small town hero never dies  
He fades a bit and then he slips  
Down into the blast furnace  
In the heat of the open hearth  
And at the punch clock he remembers  
Blackhawk and the white winged dove  
I remember your leather boots  
Pointing up into the sky  
We fell down to our knees  
Over there where the grass grew high  
Love hunters in the night  
Our faces turned into the wind  
Blackhawk where are you know  
Blackhawk and the white winged dove  
We were Blackhawk where are you know  
We were Blackhawk where are you know  
Do you still have the ring I gave you  
On the banks of Lake Bear  
Where I felt certain that I knew you  
My cool and distant debonair  
Now we drink at Liberty Station  
Another cup of muscatel  
Wrapped in the strong arms of the Union  
Raisin' kids from raisin' hell

I'ma find him though, I'ma sign him.

Hey dummy, this no accident, all of this was designed  
Took my time, crept from behind  
And I opened up your blinds, rise and shine!  
Cole World, same nigga used to drive around with yo girl  
In my mama's Civic, now I'm out here tryna get it  
I ain't like you lame ass niggas, boy I spit it how I live it  
So when you see me in the streets, man I ain't got a mimic  
Cause I ain't got an image to uphold, this real shit  
I ain't got a gimmick, I just flow and niggas went nuts for  
The boy that set fire to the booth  
In a game full of liars it turns out that I'm the truth  
Some say that rap's alive, it turns out that I'm the proof  
'Cause the ones y'all thought would save the day can't even tie my boots  
The ones y'all thought could hang with me can't even tie my noose

Real sad, baby girl I wish you still had it  
Then maybe you could get a taste of livin' Villematic  
It's Cole still at it, y'all be talkin' about the same shit  
Than how I feel about it, mama was a real addict  
That's why I don't respect that lyin' ass white shit you talkin'  
Cole plannin' funerals, you might fit the coffin

Get on your job lil man, this ain't Saturday!  
We in two different lanes, you can't navigate  
We in two different games, you playin' patty cake  
Brother you're lame, you're Shane Battier  
You out of shape, my mind run a mile a minute  
The sky's the limit, I'm so high, I'm divin' in it  
My rides is tinted, my knob's gettin' slobbed up in it  
She hollerin' God, man you would've thought that God was in it  
But it's just a nigga God invented  
The best out, foolish pride'll make you not admit it  
Word, this shit ain't vibe nigga, why you noddin' with it?  
The hate in your blood can't stop your soul from vibin' with it  
Now you all conflicted cause my flows is wicked  
And my hoes is thicker and all of yours is pickin' me

Get arrested and forget to tell my mama  
She got enough to stress about  
My nigga gonna get me out  
Then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors  
No criminal record but I'm makin' criminal records  
Isn't it ironic? Isn't it iconic?  
Jacket so expensive you wouldn't even try on it  
But it fit me perfect, I purchase it if I want it  
The city on my shoulder, so no girl, you can't cry on it  
When you make a list of the greatest aye, am I on it?  
Maybe not yet but bitch I got the clock set  
It goes tick-tock, game on lock

Yeah, this shit right here sound like a love song  
(she was in love)  
A gangsta love song, you feel me? Check it out  
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)  
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)  
  
Yeah, gangsta, uh-huh!  
Have you ever had a pretty, young saditty  
Black female with chips, from the city?  
Her momma got ends, and her daddy got ends  
And she liked to give me ends when I'm out with my friends  
Good girl, why do good girls like bad boys? (I don't know)  
When I was a kid, growing up, I never had toys  
And I think that she can figure that shit out (why?)  
Cause every time she came to pick a nigga up  
Shit, she'd take a nigga out  
Roll around town, ask the pound, they know, look  
Baby was my thing, nah, she was my low-low  
Bought my first Rolo, and then we took a photo together  
Man I hope this thing last forever  
We been together six months, and we ain't argued yet  
She loving a nigga, steady buying me shit  
And don't say shit when I dip with my click  
And understand, when I'm down and out  
May need some help with some chips  
Her mother approved of me, but her father he don't  
He probably won't, shit Pops ain't no punk  
Daddy's little girl be in a gangsta's world  
Buying me house shoes and khaki blues, California curls  
No matter what her father say, baby gon' see me  
It's like a jungle sometimes, that makes me Wonder like Stevie  
Believe me, when I say that baby was in love with a thug  
In love with a thug  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)  
Daddy I'm in love with a gangsta  
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)  
Momma I'm in love with a gangsta  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
I'm caught up in the middle and I don't know what to do  
I caught eight months in the joint, behind my crew  
That I gotta do and I'ma miss you Boo  
But I'ma write you every night and call you on the phone too  
What you gon' do? ""You know I'm goin' stay true  
But I'ma go ahead to college like my father want me to""  
Well um, off to my cell with ya body on my mind  
And I'ma call you back tomorrow round the same time  
I'm on the mainline, 9500 for short  
On another phone line, holla'n at my other hoe  
This bitch ain't saying shit, cause the bitch ain't shit  
Old fat gold-digging-ass county check receiving bitch  
I bail up in the Day Room and get in a scrap  
Niggas watching Soul Train and I wouldn't turn it back (man fuck y'all)  
Never caught slipping, always on strap  
And now I'm back in the hole with no motherfucking getback  
Sit back and contemplate, and think about baby  
And hope she don't get caught up in the world that's so crazy  
But while I'm up in Wayside, and she off in college  
She getting a little mo' than a schoolgirl knowledge  
Cause gangsta-ass niggas go to school nowadays  
I tried to make you wait, but I can't change yo' ways  
She fell in love with the local G  
And now they both in the penitentiary, she didn't mention me

Kick their heels up in the air snap their fingers for romance  
  
While the gentlemen compare blonde or black or auburn hair  
Check the motion and the style Oh, you know they take their while  
  
Hey, to make the motion more complete, yeah, to make it more a treat  
Club D'Jour is where to go come on down and see the show  
  
When the rhythm's really right you can burn it down tonight  
When the singing's really fine sweet as Spanish sherry wine  
  
When the club can't contain the beat it just rolls out in the street  
Spills on down the avenue bringing dancers to their feet.  
  
When it's good as it can be it gets better wait and see  
Oh, these folks don't ever sleep till they're passed out in the street

This story's going somewhere  
He's well hung and I am hanging on  
There's a song on the radio that says  
""Let's get this party started""  
So let's get this party started  
  
What you do on your own time's just fine  
My imaginations much worse  
I just never want to know  
And what meant the world had folded  
Like legs and fingers holding on to  
What escapes me what he has:  
A better kiss that never lasts

You said between your smiles and regrets  
""Don't say it's over""

Dead and gone yeah

And the sun burnt out tonight  
A reception less than warm, set it off  
And the sun burnt out tonight

Hating that look that's on your face  
That says there's another fool like me  
There's one born every minute  
There's one born every minute  
  
What you do on your own time's just fine  
My imaginations much worse  
I just never want to know (never want to know)  
What meant the world imploded  
Inflated then demoted all my  
Oxygen to product gas  
And suffocated my last chance

Calm before the storm (set it of, set it off)  
Calm before the storm (set it off, set it off)

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday  
I called on dear old Santa Claus  
To see what I could see  
He took me to his workshop  
And told his plans to me, so  
  
[Chorus]  
You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He's making a list and checking it twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He sees you when you're sleepin'  
He knows when you're a wake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play  
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day  
You'd better write your letter now  
And mail it right away  
Because he's getting ready  
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo

Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee

I can't get through December

Some place somewhere behind me  
I walked right through the truth  
The truth is that you're the one thing  
That always pulls me through  
This troubled life I choose

You keep my feet on the ground  
Bring me back to life  
Bring me back to life  
  
When I thought that I might be invincible  
It wasn't long before I was invisible  
To your eyes, and I swear  
There's nothing left in here  
And the more you say you don't care  
The more I know you're there

Bring me back to life  
Bring me back to life

0,"Pity a man for he don't know  
The trouble he'll pass goin' down life's road  
  
When a man is one and twenty he thinks he knows it all  
He can't see down the road of life where he'll ever fall  
But fall he will as he travels through life  
With all its pitfalls troubles and strife  
  
Now at 50 he's goin' real strong  
He has him a family and a nice little home  
But old age is creeping up his spine  
And the day is comin' when the sun won't shine  
  
Now at 60 he won't have to guess  
He's already missed the boat that leads to success  
But he's done his best and he can't see why  
The fame of life just passed him by  
  
Now at 70 he can see the light  
And he knows he's never been very bright  
But he's done his best as he's travelled by  
And now all he can do is just sit and sigh  
  
Pity a man for he don't know  
The trouble he'll pass goin' down life's road  
  
Now at 80 he's ready for the wreath  
He's wore out his hair and two sets of teeth  
He has rheumatism in his hands and feet  
And nothin' seems good to eat  
  
So you can pity him as he goes up the line  
As he wobbles on the spindle and his almost blind  
And you can tell by the way that he travels alone  
That it won't be long before he's goin' home  
  
But if he's kept the commandments as he's travelled through life  
He'll have a home in heaven where there'll be no strife  
He's worked all his life to get things the way he wants 'em  
He comes here against his will and he goes away disappointed

Never really thought I'd be able to say  
I merely visit on the weekends  
I lost my whole life and a dear friend

Dear old rab my name is ashlee  
I'm writing to you 'cuz I'm hurt  
When people laughing at me  
  
I get made fun of  
All the time at school  
They call me fat worthless  
School is so cruel  
I hate when lunch time comes  
Coz' I sit alone  
I sit there with tears on my face  
Praying to go home  
But why go home?  
All I do there is cut my wrist  
Parents don't care that I do this shit  
No one loves me it's like  
I'm a piece of trash  
I don't get why god had to make me this fat  
No one would ever care  
If I took my life  
Everynight I get closer to the knife  
And I have to say this all sound about right  
I totally understand if you don't reply  
I just need someone to talk to  
And you seem to be a nice guy  
Believe me or not but your music  
Really helps me  
  
Call me a sinner, call me a saint  
Tell me it's over I'll still love you the same  
Call me your favorite, call me the worst  
Tell me it's over I don't want you to hurt  
It's all that I can say. So, I'll be on my way  
  
Eminem:  
  
First off I just wanna say thanks for writing to me  
Your story grabbed my heart as you can see  
They will stop soon just keep fighting  
Believe it or not we been in the same position  
But no one would help me either  
Either I should of listened  
But I promise we all have a vision  
We are here for a reason don't you forget that  
Pulled what's the matter whatcha become  
And let that face you your way to young  
If we could rebound stay strong  
Whenever your hurt just play this song  
Damn I get so mad  
So who are they to judge?  
There is to much hate  
Where is the frickin love  
Kiss these days just try to deguise it  
But not bring em back  
It's just lost now I wanna find it  
I wanna stop all this bullying shit  
Cuz all it's doing is putting innocent peoples lives at risk  
You wont a girl dead what's the point in all this!  
  
I finally put it all together,  
But nothing really lasts forever  
I had to make a choice that was not mine,  
I had to say goodbye for the last time  
I kept my whole life in suitcase,  
Never really stayed in one place  
Maybe that's the way it should be,  
You know I've led my life like a gypsy  
  
I've said it so many times  
I would change my ways  
No, nevermind  
God knows I've tried  
  
Call me a sinner, call me a saint  
Tell me it's over I'll still love you the same  
Call me your favorite, call me the worst  
Tell me it's over I don't want you to hurt  
It's all that I can say. So, I'll be on my way

You got me sitting up on the shelf  
While you're out bewitching someone else.  
Do I live, Do I die  
Do I laugh, Do I cry  
What game am I supposed to loose this time?  
  
2.  
  
You got chains attached to my head  
You spreading magic honey all in your bed  
What is it you want?  
Just a puppet that talks  
Or maybe just a lover who makes love to the Dead.  
  
Step onto the stage... Just a few more minutes...  
Let's see what kind of juggler you really are.  
Say without that whip and those Bloody Boots  
Which are rented... You actually could become  
A morning star...  
But you rang your last bell  
Even your planets, they've gone to hell  
And your world turns to nothing but a bubble  
In a shotgun jar.  
And now you don't know who you really are.  
  
3.  
  
So instead of trying to make me your slave  
Why don't you just... Call it a day.  
Either way I'm gonna win  
So save yourself some wind  
Don't make me to be the last to see  
You to your grave...  
Well well, Ball and Chain... For sale.  
New day come... Masters gone to Hell...  
Well well, Ball and Chain... For sale.  
Sunrise come... Master's dying in Hell...

Been going like nothing can wait  
I gotta get my priorities straight

Take some time, waste it on number one  
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop  
Live a little, love a lot

Kick back, have a laugh, catch my breath

Maybe Miss Wonderful, I haven't met yet  
  
It just hit me like a wrecking ball  
She's giving me a wake up call

Nothing was as real  
As the street beneath my feet  
Descending into air  
  
The cauldron was a-bubbling  
The flesh was lean  
And the women moved forward  
Like piranhas in a stream  
They spread themselves before me  
An offering so sweet  
And they beckoned and they beckoned  
Come on darling eat  
  
Eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
You eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
  
They circled around me  
Natives in a ring  
And I saw their souls a-withering  
Like snakes in chains  
And they wrapped themselves around me  
Ummm what a treat  
And they rattled their tales hissin'  
Come on let's eat  
  
Eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
You eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
  
I felt a rising in my throat  
The girls a-saying grace  
And the air the viscous air  
Pressed against my face  
And it all got too damn much for me  
Just got too damn rough  
And I pushed away my plate  
And said boys I've had enough  
And I laid upon the table  
Another piece of meat  
And I opened up my veins to them  
And said come on eat  
  
Eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
You eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
You eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat

Through the peephole, all that I saw there  
Was a crooked cap on curly hair  
An' some kid squintin' back at me  
  
I said, ""If you're sellin' somethin'  
Well, I ain't buyin' nothin'  
But I appreciate you stoppin' by""  
Said, ""I ain't askin' for a dime just a minute of your time

Could you sign my petition?""  
  
Had a spiral notebook in his hand  
Handed me a chewed up pen  
An' I ask you, ""What am I signin' up for?""  
I scrolled down that wrinkled page  
Saw a couple of neighbor's names  
I kept readin' and I sat down on the porch  
  
It was a letter to the President  
With a list that numbered one to ten  
  
It said, ""Make a law where daddys don't work late  
Keep Uncle Joe an' those soldiers safe  
Give those kids on TV all they want to eat  
Put a stop to bullies on the bus  
No crime, no waits, no hate, no drugs  
Give a jacket and a job to people on the street""  
  
I said, ""Son, sounds like a world I'd like to live in""  
And I signed his petition  
  
He thanked me for my time  
I headed back inside, grabbed my beer  
An' got back to the game  
Thought by now that boy, he's three doors down  
Here I am just sittin' round  
Waitin' on the world to change  
  
Must've blocked the whole game out  
All that I could think about was  
  
Make a law where daddys don't work late  
Keep Uncle Joe an' those soldiers safe  
Give those kids on TV all they want to eat  
Put a stop to bullies on the bus  
No crime, no waits, no hate, no drugs  
Give a blanket and a job to people on the street""

Status Seeker  
In a sense I'm not beyond reproach  
The aspiration to drop a name  
When any rose might smell the same  
Maybe you'll figure it out someday  
""I want to know you now  
You know I've always believed in you.""  
  
Nothing is sacred  
You draw the bottom line  
With a dollar sign  
Change of opinion  
At the drop of a dime  
Graceless intrusion  
Are you sanctified in your  
Judgment of me?  
All that I deserve is what you were  
Unable to see  
  
In a garden where the seeds were  
Spilled  
I favored the few that stood strong  
In the sun  
As I reached for the profit of my prize  
I found I had trampled the forgotten  
Ones  
  
Nothing is sacred  
You draw the bottom line  
With a dollar sign  
Change of opinion  
At the drop of a dime  
Graceless intrusion  
Are you sanctified in your  
Judgment of me?  
All that I deserve is what you were  
Unable to see  
  
You're running in circles  
And I'm turning away  
You refused to believe  
Now I'm turning away

I'd say anything, but not goodbye  
I will run with your changes and I'm always on your side  
And there's not a word I've ever heard, that would make me change my mind  
  
Words they'll try to shake you  
Don't let them break you  
Or stop your world from turning  
When words keep you from feeling good  
Use them as fire wood and let 'em burn  
  
Like stones in your pocket people try to wear you down  
Someone always wants to take the love you've found  
So let's roll with these changes and I want you by my side  
And there's not a word I've ever heard that could make me change my mind  
  
Words they'll try to shake you  
Don't let them break you  
Or stop your world from turning  
When words keep you from feeling good  
Use them as fire wood and let 'em burn  
  
Let them burn  
Let them burn  
Underneath every word somebody's heart been broken  
With or without words, we try to forget  
  
Words they'll try to shake us  
Don't let them break us  
Or stop our world from turning  
When words keep you from feeling good  
Use them as fire wood and let 'em burn  
  
Words they'll try to shake you  
Don't let them break you  
Or stop your world, stop your world from turning 'round  
When words keep you from feeling good  
Use them as fire wood and let 'em burn  
  
Let them burn

And as I stood there mesmerized I heard my spirit scream

United we must stand  
To build a line, strategic force, they will not take a man

They won't take our world away when the children we leave  
Will have to believe in today  
  
We warn you now you things out there  
Whatever you may send  
We won't give in without a fight, a fight until the end  
With vigilance by day and night our scanners trace the sky  
A shield is sealed upon this earth, a shield you won't get by

Now that you and me are one

That open up the [?] of the last 2 billion years  
I ask myself a question  
What the fuck is gone  
But I knew that I knew it  
From the milky, milky gods

The milky, milky, milk  
Your lips get me so wet  
While I'm singing all the verses from the Tibetan Book of the Dead

It's time to look [?]  
Yeah, I'm digging it  
It's time to look [?]  
Yeah, I'm digging it  
Yeah, I'm digging it

I feel like a slab of butter  
(Yeah, I'm digging it)  
That is melting in the sun  
(Yeah, I'm digging it)  
The presence melts away  
(Yeah, I'm digging it)  
Now that you and me are one  
(Yeah, I'm digging it)  
Now that you and me are one  
(Yeah, I'm digging it)  
Now that you and me are one  
Yeah, I'm digging it

Yeah, I'm digging it

Not afraid you can throw your sticks and stones

0,"In a certain row of a garden grove  
A lady learns to sleep  
While surrounded, not where all the flowers grow  
On an empty orchard street  
She is dreaming of her holiday  
From a working glass menagerie  
Oh her hands are cold  
Unimaginable that shes warming up to me  
  
I'm a passerby in a promise land  
And I face no direction  
Somewhere between the towns of lost and found  
In the state of confusion  
Sure our dreaming is pure wonderment  
But our feelings are no accident  
If my heart is cold it won't forever be,  
Cause your warming up to me  
  
And fate is not a mission  
Its an unconditional high  
When I saw you in the garden  
You reminded me  
I can see, the stars are on your shoulders now  
And what the wind and your skin have in common  
Am I taller? Well if feels as though I'm above the ground  
You're inviting me to go down  
  
Are you warming up?  
Are you burning up?  
Warming up to love?  
Are you warming up tonight?

God knows I try to feel  
Happy for you  
Know that I am, even if I  
Can't understand, I'll take the pain  
Give me the truth, me and my heart  
We'll make it through  
If happy is her, I'm happy for you

You're dancing with her, while I'm staring at my phone  
Stone cold, stone cold  
I was your amber, but now she's your shade of gold  
  
Stone cold, baby  
God knows I try to feel  
Happy for you  
Know that I am, even if I  
Can't understand, I'll take the pain

You better take a chill and observe the skill  
of the man who can, so understand god damn  
I got a masterpiece a master plan and a brand new  
way to attack the wack cut 'em down to size  
to realize LL's back  
Don't sleep I'm too sweet to repeat a beat  
a lyric or rhyme I wouldn't waste your time  
with weak words, that's for nerds, you never heard a rhyme  
So you deserve a line rougher than rough enough is enough  
I'm, gonna slaughter choke ya smoke ya like a sauna  
You don't really wanna  
But if you wanna battle on here's a lesson, stop 'fessin  
I'm a lethal weapon, you better get to steppin  
off the stage, and outta my face  
You're too light ? save the bass  
  
[Chorus]  
Why do you think they call it dope?  
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?  
  
It seems like people-'ll never understand  
On the microphone I'm not your average man  
I cool out sometimes, I save my best rhymes  
and then the toy boy thinks that he can come and get mine  
Let your friends gas him up, talk trash and make bets  
then gets played like those kids who tried to rob Goetz  
You don't know what I'm sayin? Yo check it  
Give me any microphone and god dammit I'll wreck it!  
I'm coldblooded I'm about to mutilate  
Last year before I left I told you to wait  
But you couldn't stay loyal started goin astray  
Thinking Tom, Dick, and Harry can mess with Cool J  
Is you crazy? I'm booming, got the talent of two men  
The stamina and skill in battle to kill a few men  
The heart of a lion, the loyalty of a soldier  
I wreck your whole mob then tell ya I told ya!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cause I don't jab around you, I come inside  
Bob and weave, deceive until you get tongue tied  
Brawl for all give a lyrical display  
and next time you know better than to get in my way  
""Yo whassup wit LL?  
Will he ever make another 'Rock the Bells'?""  
Yo brothers is coming up, ""I think he's falling off  
I don't think he's still 'hard as hell'""  
See, this is the attitude, of ignorant ones  
cause they don't know, all them MC'sll get done  
One or two might say, ""Yo L'll be back""  
but the rest they be sucking on sugar smacks  
Talking that crap about who's better than me  
You think so? Just let a MC  
make me mad enough, to really wanna battle  
I put a L on his ass like he was cattle!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just cause I make a love song, or say a simple rhyme  
""Boom, move over L, it's Miller Time""  
I don't know whether to laugh, get ill or get wild  
Cause brothers don't realize, I got so many styles  
like tripling up the words, confusing all the nerds  
Heard put my sights on mics and ? flipping above the word  
to the mother, no other  
MC brother, can mess with Ladies Lover  
I'm original, I'm bright under color  
And when I get on the mic, yo I burn rubber  
Can't stand criticism, give 'em an exorcism  
Been rocking for years, now I have wisdom  
The way I'm kicking the lines you can hear my tongue twist  
and it'll have your neck spinning like you're spineless  
I'm picking 'em up, throwing 'em down  
Hyping 'em up and slowing 'em down  
All of these words with only one tongue  
Shaking 'em up and then baking 'em up  
Smash boom bash scraping 'em up  
Now you thought that was hard, I just begun  
Cause I'm a roll on the microphone  
And take control just like Al Capone  
I'm notorious, you're foolish if you sleep on me  
Cause I'm too slick to let a rapper get sweet on me  
Try to make a move for my heavyweight belt  
You get played like the Wizard of Oz witch, you melt  
Yo I'm crazy dope, with super hype lines  
and a lot of hype lines make one dope rhyme  
  
[Chorus: x2]

0,"I was 18 when I came to town  
They called it the summer of love  
Burning babies, burning flags  
The hawks against the doves  
  
I took a job at the steaming way  
Down on Caltrim St  
Fell in love with a laundry girl  
That was workin' next to me  
  
Brown hair zig zagged across her face  
And a look of half surprise  
Like a fox caught in the headlights  
There was animal in her eyes  
  
She said to me  
""Can't you see I'm not the factory kind?  
If you don't take me out of here  
I'll surely lose my mind""  
  
She was a rare thing, fine as a bee's wing  
So fine, a breath of wind might blow her away  
She was a lost child, she was runnin' wild  
(She said)  
""So long as there's no price on love, I'll stay  
You wouldn't want me any other way""  
  
We busked around the market towns  
Fruit pickin' down in Kent  
We could tinker pots and pans  
Or knives, wherever we went  
  
We were campin' down the Gower one time  
The work was mighty good  
She wouldn't wait for the harvest  
I thought we should  
  
I said to her we'll settle down  
Get a few acres dug  
A fire burning in the hearth  
And babies on the rug  
  
She said, ""Oh man, you foolish man  
That surely sounds like hell  
You might be lord of half the world  
You'll not own me as well""  
  
She was a rare thing, fine as a bee's wing  
So fine, a breath of wind might blow her away  
She was a lost child, she was runnin' wild  
(She said)  
""So long as there's no price on love, I'll stay  
You wouldn't want me any other way""  
  
We were drinking more in those days  
Our tempers reached a pitch  
Like a fool I let her run away  
When she took the rambling itch  
  
Last I heard she was living rough  
Back on the Derby beat  
A bottle of White Horse in her pocket  
A Wolfhound at her feet  
  
They say that she got married once  
To a man called Romany Brown  
Even a gypsy caravan  
Was too much like settlin' down  
  
They say her rose has faded  
Rough weather and hard booze  
Maybe that's the price you pay  
For the chains that you refuse  
  
She was a rare thing, fine as a bee's wing  
I miss her more than ever, words can say  
If I could just taste all of her wildness now  
If I could hold her in my arms today  
I wouldn't want her any other way

But here in my heart is a memory  
The way we met, the way we kissed  
The way we fell in love  
Oh, the little secrets that we shared  
When I was sad, the way you cared  
To let me know you'd understand  
The way you'd hold my hand  
Cherished memories, the things that a fellow can't forget  
Cherished memories, you're leaving but I love you yet  
And now you say that we must part  
And even though it breaks my heart  
There's one thing you can't take from me  
That's my cherished memories

The world makes sense  
There is no pretense

When you're by my side  
There is no defense

Depraved souls  
Trusting in the one thing  
The one thing that this life has not denied us

When your lips touch mine

0,"Well, it's four o'clock in the afternoon  
And the anchors have been weighed  
From Miami to Nassau  
She's bound across the waves  
She'll be headin' south through Biscayne Bay  
Into the open sea  
Yarmouth Castle, she's a-dyin' and don't know it  
Now the many years she's been to sea  
She's seen the better times  
She gives a groan of protest  
As they cast away her lines  
And the grumble of her engines  
And the rust along her spine  
Tells the Castle she's too old to be sailin'  
But the sands run out within her heart  
A tiny spark glows red  
It smolders through the evening  
There's laughter overhead  
Now the dinner's served and the cards are dealt  
And the drinks are passed around  
Deep within the fire starts a-burnin'  
Now it's midnight on the open sea  
And the moon is shinin' bright  
Some people join the party  
And others say goodnight  
There's many who are sleepin' now  
It's been a busy day  
And a tiny wisp of smoke is a-risin'  
""Oh Lord,"" she groans, ""I'm burning  
Let someone understand""  
But her silent plea is wasted  
In the playin' of the band  
Everybody's dancin' on her deck  
And they're havin' such a time  
And a voice says, ""Shut up and deal, I'm losin'""  
Deep within the Yarmouth Castle  
The fire begins to glow  
It leaps into the hallways  
And climbs and twists and grows  
And the paint she wore to keep her young  
Oh Lord, how well it burns  
And soon that old fire is a-ragin'  
Up beneath the bridge it's climbin' fast  
The captain stands aloft  
He calls up to the boatswain, says  
""Boatswain, we are lost""  
For the ragged hoses in the racks  
No pressure do they hold  
And the people down below will soon be dyin'  
All amidships, oh she's blazin' now  
It's spreadin' fore and aft  
The people are a-scramblin'  
As the fire blocks their path  
The evil smoke surrounds them  
And they're fallin' in their tracks  
And the captain in his lifeboat is a-leavin'  
Oh then the ship, Bahama Star  
Comes steamin' through the night  
She sees the Castle blazin'  
And 'tis a terrible sight  
""Jump down, jump down"", the captain cries  
""We'll save you if we can""  
Then the paint on his funnels is a-fryin'  
""God help the ones who sleep below  
And cannot find the way  
Thank God for those we rescue  
Upon this awful day""  
Now the heroes, they are many  
But the times are growin' slim  
And now from stern to bow, she's a-blazin'  
Oh the Yarmouth Castle's moanin'  
She's cryin' like a child  
You can hear her if you listen  
Above the roar so wild  
Is she cryin' for the ones who lie  
Within her molten sides?  
Or cryin' for herself, I'm a-wonderin'  
But the livin' soon were rescued  
The ones who lived to tell  
From the Star they watched her  
As she died there in the swells  
Like a toy ship on a mill pond  
She burned all through the night  
Then slipped beneath the waves in the mornin'

There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry  
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows  
There's a tree where the doves go to die  
There's a piece that was torn from the morning,  
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws  
I want you, I want you, I want you  
On a chair with a dead magazine  
In the cave at the tip of the lilly,  
In some hallway where love's never been  
On a bed where the moon has been sweating,  
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
Take its broken waist in your hand  
  
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz  
With its very own breath of brandy and Death  
Dragging its tail in the sea  
  
There's a concert hall in Vienna  
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews  
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking  
They've been sentenced to death by the blues  
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture  
With a garland of freshly cut tears?  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
Take this waltz, it's been dying for years  
  
There's an attic where children are playing,  
Where I've got to lie down with you soon,  
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns,  
In the mist of some sweet afternoon  
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow,  
All your sheep and your lillies of snow  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
With its ""I'll never forget you, you know!""  
  
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz  
With its very own breath of brandy and Death  
Dragging its tail in the sea  
  
And I'll dance with you in Vienna  
I'll be wearing a river's disguise  
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder,  
My mouth on the dew of your thighs  
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook,  
With the photographs there, and the moss  
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty  
My cheap violin and my cross  
And you'll carry me down on your dancing  
To the pools that you lift on your wrist  
O my love, o my love  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
It's yours now. It's all that there is

Yes I'm sleeping, my mind's on the blink  
I thought a page, like it's written in ink  
When I remember distant days  
I remember many things, but  
Most of all, I remember the sun  
Squinting at the sun through eyes  
Screwed up by a fireball  
Tarmac on the road is soft  
Chaff burns in a smokewall  
Yes, I weeping, a teardrop attack  
I give emotion at the drop of a hat  
When I remember days at school  
I remember many things, but  
Most of all, I remember the sun  
Sun that worked on overtime  
Fuelled our bodies, kindled fire in our minds  
Burning scars soon disappear  
Like heat that hangs like water on the road  
But most of all, I remember the sun.

They sweetly did whistle and this was their song

Along the loom of the land  
When I walked with sweet sally  
Hand upon hand  
  
And the wind it bit bitter  
For a boy of no means  
With no shoes on his feet  
And a knife in his jeans  
  
Along the loom of the land  
The mission bells peeled  
From the tower at saint mary's  
Down to reprobate fields  
  
And I saw that the world  
Was all blessed and bright  
And sally breathed softly  
In the majestic night  
  
O baby please don't cry  
And try to keep  
Your little hand upon my shoulder  
Now go to sleep  
  
The elms and the poplars  
Were turning their backs  
Past the rumbling station  
We followed the tracks  
  
We found an untrodden path  
And followed it down  
The moon in the sky  
Like a dislodged crown  
  
My hands they burned  
In the folds of her coat  
Breathing milky white air  
From deep in her throat  
  
O baby please don't cry  
And try to keep  
Your little head upon my shoulder  
Now go to sleep  
  
I told sally in whispers  
I'll never bring you harm  
Her breast it was small  
And warm in my palm  
  
I told her the moon  
Was a magical thing  
That it shone gold in winter  
And silver in spring  
  
And we walked and walked  
Across the endless sands  
Just me and my sally  
Along the loom of the land  
  
O baby please don't cry  
And try to keep  
Your little head upon my shoulder  
Now go to sleep

How the sunlight caressed all the trees  
I played all my music I sang you my love  
The chiming church bells rode the breeze

Time has a way of obscuring our memories  
And good times are hard to recall  
Basic survival and day to day living  
Leaves no time for romance at all

Every day with you, every day  
Remember that Christmas with just a few friends  
And the whole town was covered with snow  
We laughed and we loved as we skied in the sun  
It seems such a long time ago  
Love was new  
Something you said one night started me thinking  
How sweet love is as it begins  
Taken for granted it slips through your fingers  
And leaves you on needles and pins  
But there ain't no way baby that we'd let that happen  
Our love will always be new

But that's the story of my life  
  
There's comfort in my coffee cup and apples in the early fall  
They're pulling all the moorings up and gathering at the Legion Hall  
They swept away all the streamers after the Labor Day parade  
Nothing left for a dream now, only one final serenade  
  
And these are the last words I have to say  
Before another age goes by  
With all those other songs I'll have to play  
But that's the story of my life  
  
And it's so clear standing here where I am  
Ain't that what justice is for?  
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn anymore  
  
Stack the chairs on the table tops  
Hang the sheets on the chandeliers  
It slows down but it never stops  
Ain't it sweet after all these years  
  
And these are the last words I have to say  
It's always hard to say goodbye  
But now it's time to put this book away  
And that's the story of my life  
  
These are the last words I have to say  
That's why this took so long to write  
There will be other words some other day  
Ain't that the story of my life  
  
These are the last words I have to say  
Before another age goes by  
With all those other songs I'll have to play  
Ain't that the story of my life

Living and chewing on the fat  
Built upon the hazy plan  
Like foundations slipping through the sand  
  
Long teeth and whiskers like a rat  
Fearing only those present  
They got zero emotion  
And everybody's fed up with that  
  
Warm outside but very cold within  
Followed and praised for many years  
They got all the promotions  
Isn't that the way it's always been  
  
History's written always red  
It's pages are painful and clear  
It's so full of devotion  
Makes you wonder where it could have led

Aha, they won't be led

0,"Down into the dark I go, armed with just a candle and then my soul  
Cryptic messages written on the floor  
Rats are nibbling at my feet, I send one off to nevermore  
Too much darkness, spiders on my eyes  
  
Webs are hanging from my thighs, the fatter ones must die  
I see shadows walking straight and tall  
I don't know how they move, dancing on the walls  
Presence of fear, a presence so near  
  
I wonder what could be so powerful beyond the dark  
Human bones... in little chambers all along the narrow halls  
Catacomb, death over life... Catacomb, am I here to die?  
I see a light, I push some bones aside  
  
Down into the dark I go, another chamber, a chamber with a glow  
Could this be a doorway to another world?  
Or darkness playing tricks, with my little mind?  
The virgin Mary is standing tall  
  
A full size figure carved in wood up against the wall  
Her face is peeling from all the years gone by  
Is it just a statue, or is it what I'm looking for?  
I break her face and see another one instead  
  
The mummy's face appears as the bandages they fall  
Dried out face with hate upon me gaze  
How grotesque... the mummy wears a crown of thorns  
From the empty sockets where its eyes should be  
  
An entity of light is pouring out towards me  
And then the sound... Jesus Christ,what have they done to you?  
I'm running for my life, I'm running from the night  
But it's so hard to breathe, the stench down here is much too much  
  
Satan help me, help me God  
Help me anyone, anyone who hears my cry of fear  
Cold winds from far beyond the dark  
Chasing through the catacomb and breathing down my neck  
  
Human bones... in little chambers all along the narrow halls  
Catacomb, death over life... Catacomb, am I here to die?  
I know I'm here to die

Notice your image is different.  
Traits that change, it's just too quick,  
Follow on clues and guess what,  
  
That's what, it's like.  
Follow your ups and downs,  
It's safe to say that I can't tell.  
All sense aside.  
  
Left out in the cold,  
Sight of your routine getting old.  
Blame some indifference inside,  
Taken on shapes not to selective.  
  
Just what you find.  
Looking for seconds of peace of mind,  
Pieces of something to hold on to.  
A job that you just can't hold down,  
  
Distracted for seconds, you're gone.

Needing to find something,  
Is everything ok.  
  
I hope you find your niche, someday soon.  
Easy to change your phase,  
To move from where you stand,  
But you got to keep that face.  
  
Each change you plan.  
Wonder, is everything ok,  
The problem is hesitation.

Well I guess you know of course I lost the farm that daddy sweated all his
life to keep  
And even worked sometimes by moonlight when all of us kids were sound to
asleep  
Now I guess we were all just too busy fulfilling each one's worldly dreams  
To even care when they took the old chair along with all the other things  
You know if you could capture all the love that we found in that old chair  
  
Why you could wipe out all the hatred in this old world  
And you'd still have a lotta love to spare

And look at all the teeth marks put there when we were small

Tells a tale  
Of times when kings and queens sipped wine from goblets gold,  
And the brave would lead their ladies from out of the room to arbors cool.  
  
A time of valor, and legends born  
A time when honor meant much more to a man than life  
And the days knew only strife to tell right from wrong  
Through lance and sword.  
  
Why, why can we never be sure till we die  
Or have killed for an answer,  
Why, why do we suffer each race to believe  
That no race has been grander  
It seems because through time and space  
Though names may change each face retains the mask it wore.  
  
A dusty table  
Musty smells  
Tarnished silver lies discarded upon the floor  
Only feeble light descends through a film of grey  
That scars the panes.  
Gone the carving,  
And those who left their mark,  
Gone the kings and queens now only the rats hold sway  
And the weak must die according to nature's law  
As old as they.

Mysteries I swallowed whole  
  
Happiness I couldn't share I will leave you  
Promises I never kept I will leave you  
Stories that I never told  
Principles betrayed or sold  
  
Love I tried to spread too wide I will leave you  
Muscles you can grow in hate I will leave you  
Summer darkness  
Winter light  
Young mans shame and  
Old mans pride  
  
When I leave you  
I will hate to leave you  
That's the heat that grows  
With growing old  
  
So never let me leave you  
Never let me leave you  
Cold

0,"One step into the light  
One step away from night  
It's the hardest step you're gonna take  
The ship to take you there  
Is waiting at the head  
Of the stairs that lead up through your opening mind  
  
Above the dark despair  
Shines a light that we can share  
Close your eyes and look up in between your brows  
Then slowly breathing in  
Feel the life force streaming in  
Hold it there, then send it back to him  
  
All the old things are returning  
Cosmic circles ever turning  
All the truth we've been yearning for  
Life is our saviour, saviour, saviour, save your soul  
  
The river of living breath  
Is flowing through the sun  
He was there before the earth began  
The world will drag on you  
Use his love to pull you through  
Find the mission of your life and start to be  
  
All the old things are returning  
Cosmic circles ever turning  
All the truth we've been yearning for  
Life is our saviour, saviour, saviour, save your soul  
  
There's one thing I can do  
Play my mellotron for you  
Try to blow away your city blues  
Your dreams are not unfound  
Get your feet back on the ground  
The truth will set us free, we cannot lose  
We cannot love, we just have to choose

And Autumn reached for her golden crown  
I looked behind as I heard a sigh  
But this was the time of no reply.  
  
The sun went down and the crowd went home  
I was left by the roadside all alone  
I turned to speak as they went by  
But this was the time of no reply.  
  
The time of no reply is calling me to stay  
There is no hello and no goodbye  
To leave there is no way.  
  
The trees on the hill had nothing to say  
They would keep their dreams till another day  
So they stood and thought and wondered why  
For this was the time of no reply.  
  
Time goes by from year to year  
And no one asks why I am standing here  
But I have my answer as I look to the sky  
This is the time of no reply.

(Written by S. Wooley)  
  
Well in North Carolina, way back in the hills  
Lived my old pappy and he had him a still  
He brewed white lightnin' 'til the sun went down  
Then he'd fill him a jug and he'd pass it around  
Mighty, mighty pleasin, pappy's corn squeezin'  
Whshhhoooh. .. White lightnin'  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well the ""G"" men ""T"" men revenuers, too  
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew  
They were looking, tryin to book him,  
But my pappy kept a-cookin'  
Whshhhoooh. .. White lightnin'  
  
Well I asked my old pappy why he called his brew  
White lightnin' 'stead of mountain dew  
I took a little sip and right away I knew  
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue  
Thunder started flashin', lightnin' started clashin'...  
Whshhhoooh. .. White lightnin'  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
Well a city slicker came and he said ""I'm tough""  
I think I wanna taste that powerful stuff  
He took one slug and drank it on down  
And I heard him a moanin' as he hit the ground  
Thunder started flashin', lightnin started clashin'  
Mmmmm.... White lightnin'

Crank it up, yo, and let me hear that system bump  
'cause with this here I gotta get over the hump  
And you know what that means (that means)  
Kickin' out funky rhymes ""G"" (rhymes ""G"")  
I got the funky rhymes that'll please (that'll please)  
And my jams break overseas (overseas)  
So when I come to town be prepared to be hyped up  
'cause when the mic's turned on I get psyched up (psyched up)  
The V.I.P. gets it started with intro  
Bustin' smooth moves on top of instrumental  
Turn up the beats in the Jeeps louder  
Here we go y'all - with minutes of power  
Minutes of power  
[Verse 2]  
Minutes of power  
When I step to the mic - bro  
Vanilla Ice does it right  
And what I'm sayin' is - Yo!  
Ya suckers frontin' what ya wantin' is for me to fade  
Thought I was outta here fools  
I ain't goin' away  
Back with the track that will keep my bank fat  
HA! Vanilla's got the flavor for the funky format  
And if you're not givin' up the credit I seek  
VIP's in the house and they're ready to creep  
Now whatcha gonna do when my boys are on you?  
You know a hard head makes for a soft shoe  
So turn it up for the passengers - LOUDER!  
It's Vanilla Killa with the Minutes of Power  
[Verse 3]  
Walk through the smoke on the stage  
And the girls scream  
Ice gets 'em hot, then they melt like ice cream  
Flowin' with the swiftness  
Kickin' it with the quickness  
Fella's gettin jealous cause their girlies want a quick kiss  
When I'm rolllin' around in my 5.0 drop top  
Turning up the sounds  
'cause I want to bump the hip hop  
People gettin' mad 'cause they hear the big bass hit  
I turn it up more just to let cha know I won't quit  
Ice has got it locked down and there's no stoppin' it  
When I hear a track like this  
You know that I'll be rocking it  
Sounds so sweet, it could never be sour  
Here we go y'all with the  
M.......minutes of power  
[Verse 4]  
Now's the time for the Ice to let a rhyme rip  
Loadin' up my lyrics with a 9 double M clip  
Shootin' all enemies, you're not even a friend of me  
I ain't Spike Lee so I do the wrong thing, G  
So down with Luther Campbell OH NO  
I don't think so  
Travel state to state an' and the Ice man rips shows  
Steppin' in my path an' you might get broken  
I got it goin' on an' you know I ain't jokin  
Power every hour an' the Ice keeps risin  
Sellin' out arenas so don't look surprised  
When Vanilla shows up an' the place explodes  
An' if ya missed it - catch the next episode!  
Gather up your troops  
Rush 'em to the record store  
An' pick up the new LP from the Ice Man  
So let the funk flow louder  
And let me hit cha - hit cha - hit cha  
With the, with the

And lock love away in some safe place  
Where you won't lose love and keep love  
Each day untouched, so warm and near  
Where love will stay, so pure and clear  
The evenings pass and I wonder  
Where you are sleeping tonight  
Are you awake running through memories  
Remembering how good it felt when love took hold  
Our future plans that won't unfold  
Now days are long  
Just patches of time thrown together like clouds  
Of empty hours blinded by pictures of places we knew  
And now in space I stare  
Without your soul and voice to share  
It all seems lost  
Left are just words but without much to say  
'Cause if love's real  
You have to trust and let love go its way  
If love is real  
If love is real  
If love is real

She'll contemplate seduction, she'll calculate the catch  
When she moved, her presence speared me  
When she spoke, her words ensnared me  
Watch the lizard, watch the lizard,  
Watch the lizard with the crimson veil  
  
She crucified my heart in the depth of a satin grave  
As I lay in sweating monologue I sensed the love light fade  
Within the spiral of the cigarette  
You betrayed your bedside etiquette  
I saw the lizard, I saw the lizard  
I touched the lizard with the crimson veil  
  
I've seen a different doorway shut a million times before  
The smiling she chameleon, the smiling vinyl whores  
  
They know what they want, they sing your name  
And glide between the sheets  
I never say no, in chemical glow we'll let our bodies meet  
So was it just a fuck, was it just a fuck, just another fuck I said  
Loving just for laughs, carnal autograph, lying on a lizard's bed  
  
So was it just a fuck, was it just a fuck, just another fuck I bled  
Degraded and alone, raped and still forlorn

0,"""It's a cold day for September"", was all I thought to say  
When I saw you on the street the other day  
I knew something changed between us, all the talk we made was small  
But what do you say to someone when they've heard you say it all?  
It's an awkward conversation, in a most peculiar way...  
Chorus:  
How did we get from saying ""I love you"" to ""I'll see you around  
Someday? ""  
It seemed like only days ago, we had so much to say  
Did we take it all for granted?, did it all gets thrown away?  
""It calls for rain this afternoon"", she finally replied  
Then there was such a stuttering silence, that I felt my mouth go dry  
We'll talk about the weather, cause there's not much more to say...  
Chorus x 2  
Has all the ice been broken,  
All our surfaces been scratched  
Have all the words been spoken,  
Have we finally met our match?  
Cause it's an awkward conversation,  
In a most peculiar way

Then you could know the one  
Who loves you so much more  
If only I could help you out  
But God's the only one  
  
What are you waiting for

It seems to wash away  
Can't find a will to go on  
But I am here to say there's hope  
You must carry on  
Jesus will light your way  
He'll give you all that you need  
No need to be afraid all you've got to do is believe

That bompy little couch that made into a bed  
Shower down the hall and footsteps through the wood

Times were hard for us for quite a while  
But through those hungry days she faced it with a smile  
Not wanting me to know she's carrying my child  
She tried to ease my mind  
And for my woman's love, for my woman's love  
Each day I thank the Lord above for my sweet woman's love  
Through the years of moving town to town  
Still searching for a dream somehow we never found  
And wondering if we would ever settle down  
Her love never died  
And if I have many things today  
I owe it to the love I had along the way  
No matter what went wrong, no matter come what may  
She stood by my side  
And for my woman's love, for my woman's love

Get it on, give it up, give it in  
You stole the wages of sin  
Cause you're in it to win  
  
[Chorus]  
Nine lives, nine times to die  
I've been bitten once  
But I won't be twice shy  
Nine lives, nine times to die  
Come on and show me your hand - Tim McGraw  
Cause it's your turn to cry - Tim McGraw  
  
Hey!  
  
Let it roll, let em go, let em fly  
Took a chance on a chance  
But the aces were high  
Get it on, give it up, give it in  
You stole the wages of sin  
Got to be in it to win  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nine lives, nine times to die  
I've been bitten once  
But I won't be shy twice  
Nine lives, nine times to die  
It's Russian roulette  
With every roll of your dice  
  
And nine lives is all we're gonna get?  
I said all we're gonna get yeah?  
Nine lives, nine times to die  
You've just bitten less than your nine lives.

0,"The facts we hate  
We'll never meet walking down the road  
Everybody yelling ""hurry up, hurry up!""  
But I'm waiting for you, I must go slow  
I must not think bad thoughts  
  
What is this world coming to?  
Both sides are right but both sides are murdered  
I give up, why can't they?  
I must not think bad thoughts  
  
The civil wars and the uncivilized wars  
Conflagrations leap out of every poor furnace  
The food cooks poorly and everyone goes hungry  
From then on it's  
Dog eat dog, dog eat body, and body eat dog  
I can't go down there, I can't understand it  
I'm a no good coward  
And an American too, a north American that is  
Not a south or a central or a native American  
Oh, I must not think bad thoughts  
  
I'm guilty of murder of  
Innocent men, innocent women, innocent children  
Thousands of them  
My planes, my guns, my money, my soul  
My blood on my hands  
It's all my fault  
I must not think bad thoughts  
  
The facts we hate  
You'll never hear us  
I hear the radio, it's finally gonna play new music  
You know the british invasion  
But what about the  
Minutemen, flesheaters, DOA, big boys, and the black flag  
Were the last American bands to get played on the radio  
Please bring the flag, please bring the flag  
Glitter disco synthesizer, night school  
All the noble savage drum drum drum  
Astronauts go back in time to hang out with the cave people  
It's about time, it's about space  
It's about some people in the strangest places  
Woody Guthrie sang about B-E-A-T-S, not B-E-A-T-S  
I must not think bad thoughts  
I must not think bad thoughts

I traveled for the home, where westward falls the hill.  
And for many, many a village, in the darkness of the valley,  
distant music reached me, peels of bells were ringing.  
  
Then spread my thoughts to olden times, to that first of Christmases  
when shepherds who were watching, heard music in the fields.  
And they sat there and they marveled, and they knew they could not tell  
whether it were angels, or the bright stars a singing.  
  
But to me heard a far, it was starry music,  
the singing of the angels, the comfort of our Lord.  
Words of old that come a traveling, by the riches of the times,  
and I softly listened, as I stood upon the hill.  
And I softly listened, as I stood upon the hill.

Ask yourself a question now there's a multiple choice  
""You've only one shot, get it right"", says a distance voice  
Don't get your head into a spin  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
The enemy is closing in see the white of his eye  
He's taking in his prey in sight it's just a matter of time  
May the games begin the best man win  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
Is it the pride in you that wont let go  
Is it the fool that wont let it show  
  
Free yourself  
If only you could see yourself  
If you could see yourself  
  
And when the heavens opened up and the walls come tumbling down  
You know there is the only place to go  
And when you've had enough of fighting  
And every mean trick under the sun  
But still you fear the worst is yet to come  
Take the money and run  
  
Count the bottles one by one as they fall to the ground  
Search your mind your heart your soul until the answer is found  
But watch your step the ice is thin  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
The man in black looks down on you the insignificant one  
To be or not if all so true the deal is almost done  
It matters not you're lost to him  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
Is it the pride in you that wont let go  
Is it the fool that wont let it show?  
  
Free yourself  
If only you could see yourself  
If you could see yourself  
  
And when the heavens opened up and the walls come tumbling down  
You know it is the only place to go  
And when you've had enough of fighting

The way it looks I'll probably hang cause there ain't no hope on a chain gang

Don't you ever see the starvation in the city where you live  
All the needless hunger all the needless pain?  
  
I haven't been there lately, the country is so fine  
But my neighbors don't seem hungry 'cause they haven't got the time

The city of hope  
  
On the edge of the world, across oceans of blue  
It's a place where a dream has a chance to come true  
Don't be fooled by illusions or falling from grace  
Make your own destiny, find your own place  
Where the streets beat the lessons of trouble open play  
  
Never stop believin', change will come  
There's a city of hope beyond our fears  
Where miracles happen, where truth can be heard  
Don't you wanna go to the city of hope  
Founded on faith, connecting us all  
A network of love to answer the call  
Yeah, that's where I am from  
The city of hope  
  
I hear them whisper, ""send in a prayer,""  
A cry to the spirit where they no longer wonder  
  
Never stop believin', change will come  
There's a city of hope beyond our fears  
Where miracles happen, where truth can be heard  
Don't you wanna go to the city of hope  
  
Yeah that's where I am from  
The city of hope

0,"Babes in the wood walking through' snow  
Big bad wolf at the window  
Not much choice in the matter now  
Some must lead some must follow  
  
Touch can mean distance to some people  
Touch can mean prison or be like a cage  
I always thought that life could be more simple  
Specially in this day and age  
  
Babes in the wood walking through' snow  
Big bad wolf at the window  
Not much choice in the matter now  
Some must lead some must follow  
  
They got the time they got the need  
The world's getting weird the wolf's running free  
But that's another story this their story  
  
Babes in the wood eager and keen  
Soft as the fern underneath them  
Wet to the skin from their own hot glow  
No more wolf at the window  
  
Touch can mean distance to some people  
Touch can mean I own you forever and a day  
If only life could be more simple  
Specially in this day and age  
  
Babes in the wood walking through' snow  
Big bad wolf at the window  
Not much choice in the matter now  
Some must lead some must follow  
  
But touch can be a blessing to other people  
Touch can bring blossom to things that decay  
I think life should be that simple  
Specially in this day and age  
  
Babes in the wood walking through' snow  
Big bad wolf at the window  
Not much choice in the matter now  
Some must lead some must follow

The way you looked when we met  
It's easy to remember so hard to forget  
I hear you whisper I always love you  
I know it's over and yet  
It's easy to remember but oh so hard to forget  
So I must dream to have your hand caress me fingers press me tight  
I'd rather dream than have that lonely feeling stealing through the night  
Each little moment is clear before me  
And though it brings me regret  
It's easy to remember but so hard to forget  
So I must dream to have your hand caress me fingers press me tight  
I'd rather dream than have that lonely old feeling stealing through the night  
Each little moment is clear before me  
And though it brings me regret  
It's easy to remember and so hard to forget

And hoping something better comes tomorrow.

Here's hoping all the days ahead  
Won't be as bitter as the ones behind you.  
Be an optimist instead,  
And somehow happiness will find you.  
Forget what happened yesterday,  
I know that better things are on the way.  
  
It's really good to see you rocking out

Living like you just begun.

There was something more I had to do before you turned and walked away  
Promises broken easily  
Mad as we are, cannot fail, lives across my silver screen  
Soaks it out, burns a trail speed of light, hope flickering  
Pins and needles climbing up  
The spite of bold cathedrals ever high  
I'm not sure that I could cross this river, I'm not sure I want to try  
Shadows is that's left of you  
Mad as we are, cannot fail, lives across my silver screen  
Soaks it out, burns a trail speed of light, hope flickering  
Like moths in the night  
Promises broken easily

0,"Rainey Williams' playground was the Mott Haven streets where he ran past
melted candles and flower wreaths, names and photos of young black faces,
whose death and blood consecrated these places. Rainey's mother said, ""Rainey
stay at my side, for you are my blessing you are my pride. It's your love here
that keeps my soul alive. I want you to come home from school and stay
inside.""  
  
Rainey'd do his work and put his books away. There was a channel showed a
western movie everyday. Lynette brought him home books on the black cowboys of
the Oklahoma range and the Seminole scouts who fought the tribes of the Great
Plains. Summer come and the days grew long. Rainey always had his mother's
smile to depend on. Along a street of stray bullets he made his way, to the
warmth of her arms at the end of each day.  
  
Come the fall the rain flooded these homes, here in Ezekiel's valley of dry
bones, it fell hard and dark to the ground. It fell without a sound. Lynette
took up with a man whose business was the boulevard, whose smile was fixed in
a face that was never off guard. In the pipes 'neath the kitchen sink his
secrets he kept. In the day, behind drawn curtains, in Lynette's bedroom he
slept.  
  
Then she got lost in the days. The smile Rainey depended on dusted away, the
arms that held him were no more his home. He lay at night his head pressed to
her chest listening to the ghost in her bones.  
  
In the kitchen Rainey slipped his hand between the pipes. From a brown bag
pulled five hundred dollar bills and stuck it in his coat side, stood in the
dark at his mother's bed, brushed her hair and kissed her eyes.  
  
In the twilight Rainey walked to the station along streets of stone. Through
Pennsylvania and Ohio his train drifted on. Through the small towns of Indiana
the big train crept, as he lay his head back on the seat and slept. He awoke
and the towns gave way to muddy fields of green, corn and cotton and an
endless nothin' in between. Over the rutted hills of Oklahoma the red sun
slipped and was gone. The moon rose and stripped the earth to its bone.

Now that there's nothing left  
That can shut you down  
It doesn't take much to break  
A life beyond the things you live for  
Into a place where you have all that it takes  
We have watched and we have tried  
And now I need this  
Know this taste this want this...  
So swell the black sails with wind  
And let me reap my rewards and start again

0,"Yo, I don't appreciate you telling me  
The way that I should live  
No, I think the choices you've laid out for me  
The end is negative  
So, take all your imagery and ideology  
Yes I'll be fine  
When you go I'd rather not display my physical  
I'd rather use my mind, oh  
You act like all I am to be is, just a sexy, sexy thing  
Just a showpiece for all to see like a Bently or your diamond ring  
I know that I am more than that, don't believe the hype  
The One who made the stars and sun gave meaning to my life  
Oh, I don't need you to define my be-E-A-you-T-why  
I'd rather draw the line  
Oh, I don't need you on my team, what you're selling's a pipe dream  
And I don't need it, baby  
Hey, it seems a shame to me I've been reduced  
To an object of lust and hate  
No way, please understand that I refuse to be  
Simply a height and weight  
This day, somewhere we've lost the value  
Of what a woman is supposed to be  
A queen, respected and defined by her creator  
Size 24, size 10 or size 3  
You act like all I am to be is, just a sexy, sexy thing  
Just a showpiece for all to see like a Bently or your diamond ring  
I know that I am more than that, don't believe the hype  
The One who made the stars and sun gave meaning to my life  
Oh, I don't need you to define my be-E-A-you-T-why  
I'd rather draw the line  
Oh, I don't need you on my team, what you're selling's a pipe dream  
And I don't need it, baby  
It's my choice and I will decide, I won't let you destroy my pride  
I'm no showpiece for you to hide and lose all that I am inside  
God made me and I'm beautiful, I won't dress like that kind of girl  
Are-E-S-P-E-see-T, see, that's the way that you got to look at me  
It's my choice and I will decide, I won't let you destroy my pride  
I'm no showpiece for you to hide and lose all that I am inside  
God made me and I'm beautiful, I won't dress like that kind of girl  
Are-E-S-P-E-see-T, see, that's the way that you got to look at me  
Oh, I don't need you to define my be-E-A-you-T-why

She said there was nothing that I could have done  
There was nothing nobody could say  
Me and you weve known each other ever since we were sixteen  
I wished I would have known I wished I could have called you  
Just to say goodbye bobby jean  
  
Now you hung with me when all the others turned away turned up their noise  
We liked the same music we liked the same bands we liked the same clothes  
We told each other that we were the wildest, the wildest things wed ever  
Seen  
Now I wished you would have told me I wished I could have talked to you  
Just to say goodbye bobby jean  
  
Now we went walking in the rain talking about the pain from the world we hid  
Now there aint nobody nowhere nohow gonna ever understand me the way you did  
Maybe you'll be out there on that road somewhere  
In some bus or train traveling along  
In some motel room therell be a radio playing  
And you'll hear me sing this song  
Well if you do you'll know I'm thinking of you and all the miles in between  
And I'm just calling one last time not to change your mind  
But just to say I miss you baby, good luck goodbye, bobby jean

Though standin' by your side  
And there were nights we were so in love  
That lovin' made me blind

It's so easy to begin  
But it's so hard to stop this love  
It's just so hard to stop  
When a heart that's lookin' for lovin' leads you in  
It's so easy to begin  
And I've at least saved some lessons from  
A time I fell apart  
And I know you've been wondering why  
I look at you so hard  
But I never want to wake up someday  
And wonder where we've been

A jug of wine to numb my mind  
But what good does it do  
The jug runs dry and still I cry

Of a love I thought was true  
Your memory is chained to me

In a thrashed bedroom, sharp with needles and knives  
Reach for the crutches that keep in motion  
Vague memories that keep me alive

All alone in our room, in the middle of the night  
Kill the sun, yes, kill the sun  
Kill the sun  
Come on, come on, stop the light  
  
Yes, I 've got sunshine

Pure white evilwrapped around my eyes

In a drop of water love  
And even as I'm climbing up the stairs

And then empty arms that comes  
With the morning star  
Well, made my bed of  
Cut roses by understanding  
That the cause  
It just comes first  
With my Mrs. Jesus  
The gospel changes meaning  
If you follow John or Paul  
And could you ever let it be  
The Mary of it all  
And even as I'm climbing up the stairs  
Well, life lines and suicide crimes  
There's the something every day  
And there's someone always paging

The personals are great  
If you're my way

Quite open minded but still quite aware  
Followed the sunrise right through from dawning  
Picking out landmarks that said I was there  
Led to positions by stern faced leaders  
Who never let one smile depart from their face  
  
Then with an arm raise the slaughter is started  
One or two crack up and start to cry  
Selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow  
Every few moments I see I friend die  
Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight  
As into the battle we are all led  
  
Killer, killer, keep your thoughts at bay  
Maiming, destroying, every single day  
Is this the way that you get your fun  
Slaying, waylaying, in the heat of the midday sun  
  
Get out, get out, go and do your job  
Rape and pillage, squander all and rob  
You make me sick, getting paid for murder  
You wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh no  
You never ever dream to hurt her  
  
Hero, hero, you have done so well  
So sit back and lick your wounds, cause you won't go to hell  
Take your medal, wear it now with pride  
Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside

Nine years worth of breakin' my back  
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard  
See how he glides, why he's lighter than air

Where is your star?  
Is it far, is it far, is it far?  
When do we leave?  
I believe, yes, I believe  
  
In the heat and the rain  
With whips and chains  
To see him fly  
So many die  
We build a tower of stone  
With our flesh and bone  
Just to see him fly  
But don't know why  
Now where do we go?  
  
Hot wind, moving fast across the desert  
We feel that our time has arrived  
The world spins, while we put his dream together  
A tower of stone to take him straight to the sky  
Oh I see his face!  
  
Where is your star?  
Is it far, is it far, far?  
When do we leave?  
Hey, I believe, I believe

We build a tower of stone  
With our flesh and bone  
To see him fly  
But we don't know why  
Ooh, now where do we go  
  
All eyes see the figure of the wizard  
As he climbs to the top of the world  
No sound, as he falls instead of rising  
Time standing still, then there's blood on the sand  
Oh I see his face!  
  
Where was your star?  
Was it far, was it far  
When did we leave?  
We believed, we believed, we believed  
  
In heat and rain  
With whips and chains  
To see him fly  
So many died  
We built a tower of stone  
With our flesh and bone  
To see him fly  
  
But why  
In all the rain  
With all the chains  
Did so many die  
Just to see him fly  
  
Look at my flesh and bone  
Now, look, look, look, look,  
Look at his tower of stone  
I see a rainbow rising  
Look there, on the horizon  
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home

Gone are the old times when we used to say  
Oh a woman was younger she knew what to do  
Oh but I look around me, now that's not so  
  
I'm lost on that open road no peace do I find  
Maybe the wind'll blow a melody and ease my mind  
  
But soon love is broken, they'll take you away  
Oh the wars they been growing as no relief  
And the old men who ruled them oh they're just like thieves  
They rob from the sunshine, oh the air ain't so clean  
Our rivers are dirty where once we could see  
  
A smile from your lady friend looking down  
Look at that river hey did you ever shiver  
Well the earth is broken there is no one to save  
  
I remember quite freely only yesterday  
Ah the letter that I read from you read this way  
Take care lonesome Timmy, ah don't you start  
Thinking you're the only one year that's gone  
Out on your lonesome road hey lend a hand to your friend  
Yes he's just as lonely and the wind keeps you cold  
  
Remember the rivers that once did flow clean  
  
Ah sometimes I wonder how this old world keeps spinning 'round  
All the old folks have gone west, Lord preparing to die  
All except for a few of us hangers on  
Living each day with trivial hearts  
  
We just stop once in a while cry over the news  
In some foreign far city your brother's shot down  
  
Because there was a reason a gun had a hand  
And the old man killed youth, squeezed down its hope  
Now I'm just waiting brother waiting for the land  
Soon in my country there won't be a friend  
Each one is trying so hard to defend  
That one one last heartbeat before he's tugged away  
  
Lost in the mechanized efficient world logical skies  
  
Ah but no song was written on without a tear in your eyes  
Are we the last ones, the last ones to try

And we drank the life glass empty but nothing disappears  
And we swam a changing ocean

And watched some others fall

When I look at you  
I melt like a candle  
You light a fire in me  
What am I to do  
I just hope I can handle  
The heat and the smoke blinding me  
This feeling, this fire  
This burning desire  
Is raging its way through my soul  
And if you feel the same  
Help me fan the flames  
'Til we're burning out of control  
Burning to know you  
Burning to show you  
And I've felt this way from the start  
Burning with passion  
I do hope it's lasting  
And it's burning a hole in my heart  
You kindle in me  
A warm glowing feeling  
A spark and a flicker of hope  
It's more than a game  
And like moths to a flame  
We're drawn to its warmth and its glow  
These embers of love  
Are fueled by the notion  
This could be an eternal flame  
Consumed by the blaze  
I fear it's too late  
'Cause this torch that I hold bears your name  
Oh, and I'm burning to know you  
Burning to hold you

Then get my a 40ounce from kem with liqueur  
Slide by millennium book  
One more spot to hit before it gets dark  
Lake sure we drive  
Slip till we slide  
Summertime on the westside, westside, westside  
  
We be rolling on most 24s  
Cumming down you're strip  
312 and 213 area codes  
So that girls don't trip  
  
Drop up in the summer time  
And we rolling through the block with the sun shining and I  
Just wanna ride, I just wanna ride  
Go to the mall and I hit the gym  
And have a pool party, gets some chicks all swim  
I just wanna ride, I just wanna ride

I have never known  
There's hope beyond  
Your wildest dreams

Is nothing to extreme

In a lover's eyes  
I can see your world  
Beautiful and new  
And although I'm not sure  
Where it's leading to  
We will travel on  
Our fate unknown  
And for once  
I know I'm not alone  
It's a trade we make  
A sacrifice

Is surely worth the price  
If we survive  
Love holds no greater price

Break down the barriers but  
Don't bend the rules  
Never forget your roots

And he'll steer the heart in the  
Pursuit of the dream

Thinking now and then  
About the way you want your life to be  
Anticipating what lies  
Just around the bend  
Can't wait to see  
  
Comes the time of decision  
Some you dodge and some you should face

Choices that will make you fall

One day you will see it all

I saw you sittin' in the corner counting change,  
Like you were counting your daydreams  
Then your eyes, they suddenly hit me like a railroad train  
  
Oh, sometimes I think I might be immune to a guy like you  
But I can't walk away, no I can't walk away  
Oh, tonight I see you're at the end of the line, well, me too  
But we all gotta pay  
  
I know you'd be good to me  
I know you'd try to be good to me  
But in the end, baby can't depend on no one else  
When the chips are down, I have found  
You better be good to yourself, good to yourself  
  
I guess I've known you before, maybe in high school  
or maybe you're just one more guy I went looking for  
The boy next door  
Or maybe I'm the girl with the see-through eyes  
But I watch too many movies,  
I get tangled in the story of someone else's life  
Baby, who am I, and who are you?  
  
Oh, sometimes I go to bed at night  
And I think that I'm with you  
Then I say a little prayer, 'cause I threw it all away  
The other day you called up to see if I miss you  
And all I could say was  
  
I know you'd be good to me  
I know you'd try to be good to me  
But in the end, baby can't depend on no one else  
When the chips are down, I have found  
You better be good to yourself, good to yourself  
  
Night has a clever disguise  
She makes me believe that I'm lonely  
I should know by now if I can make it to tomorrow  
I can work it out  
  
'cause in the end, baby can't depend on no one else  
When the chips are down, I have found  
You better be good to yourself, good to yourself

Hope you'll listen to it well  
Means no different than the others do  
It won't change you I can tell  
  
[Chorus:]  
Anyway, I love you  
Everyday I get more sure  
Anyway, I love you  
More and more and more and more and more  
  
I have so much I can offer you  
More to please you with than most  
But trying to tie you down is harder than trying to hold on to a ghost  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
So if you ever feel the need for me, darlin'  
Let it carry you along  
Don't be shy and try to hold it down  
'Cause what you feel just can't be wrong

I've seen kings, rolling in the mire,  
I've seen God, point the finger of  
doom to our foes.  
I have fought in the holiest wars,  
I have smashed, some of the holiest jaws  
I've been jailed, been impaled, and  
been dragged through the world.  
One thing, I have learned through  
these years,  
Is that no man, should be stricken  
with fear  
It should be that he walks with no  
care in the world.  
So my friends, who are gathered here  
today,  
Hear this clear, for I'll not further say,  
That no man, shall cause me to take  
up arms again.

But sporadically the circles appear  
Baffling all through the history of known man  
Since fuckin' with the mystery of stone hedge  
Aliens, cults, witches with lawn mowers, mind blowers  
Nobody knows what for sure  
Bloody nose when I walk in the vicinity  
But I can read them and I believe that I need them  
I'm runnin' through a wheat field, chasin' a ghost that loves circles  
Use it for portals and time holes  
And dance backwards, and chant with the crow people  
At the crop circle, I've come to know people  
Under moon rays lighten up my new ways ?  
They mow them in two days, 100 years from now we'll pay for that mishap  
With another motherfucking hurricane bitch slapped  
  
[Chorus]  
The crop circles are talking to me  
Circle something, circle something  
The crop circles are talking to me  
Circle something, circle something  
Something solely meant just for me  
Circle something, circle something  
The crop circles are talking to me  
Circle something, circle something  
  
This ball of mud that we live on is alive  
You try to wipe its mouth, it's gonna wipe us out  
I lay in a field alone in the middle of the night  
Try to get my life right, pray for bright lights  
Set flames to the wheat rows during an eclipse  
And the spirits will come out, dance, catch you a glimpse  
They're like artists, connecting the stars in rare fashion  
Intricately placed with secrets of white magic  
I'm running through the moon lit fields  
Following a little orb light hoping it might reveal any secret  
Its dancing, and I can't catch up  
And I almost ran head first into a truck  
No compass will work, and I'm lookin' for answers  
Why the sands of my hour glass fall off backwards?  
Have I lost you, cause I've lost me too  
But if you're hiding in the crops I will come find you  
  
The crop circles are talking to me  
Circle something, circle something  
The crop circles are talking to me  
Circle something, circle something  
Something solely meant just for me

40,000 years ago, the stoning of a young man  
His story written in the crops near Spokane  
In England the face of a dead woman shown  
Etched out a wheat field uniquely woven  
  
Hieroglyphics, mathematical genius, predicting the orbital patterns of Venus  
In the grass behind your grandpas wood barn  
Complex designs drops seconds before dawn  
  
Dead birds, scattered throughout the patterns of art  
No explanation left by the shadows of dark  
Batteries drained of they power in seconds  
I'm layin' in the crop circle countin' my blessings  
  
And my heart, tho?, headaches, and nausea were creeping  
And your nose will bleed while you're sleepin'  
  
Don't go near there, don't dare, be ware  
Unless your like us, and don't care

Extremely wealthy  
I swung in the trees  
And did as I pleased  
I thought I was rich  
Oh yeah  
Such sweet seduction  
I could feel the suction  
Greasing my palm  
And doing no harm  
Just making some deals  
What a bitch  
  
Money talks to me  
Whispers in my ear  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want  
  
I had rising stock  
So I got more pockets  
I knew somewhere to stick it  
Where no-one would nick it  
I kinda went private  
And then, aha  
Such sweet seclusion  
No more intrusion  
Too much food on my plate  
But there's guards at the gate  
Such joy  
I could almost die of it  
  
Money talks to me  
Lays it on the line  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want  
  
Money goes to money  
Yes it always returns  
Finds its way back to the big house  
Where it lives all alone  
Wraith like silent partners  
Operators of the system  
Give words of quiet assurance  
To an otherwise healthy victim  
  
It's all coming back to me  
I would swing in the trees  
And I'd swim in the ocean  
I used to show some emotion  
  
I was not to blame  
I feel no shame  
The structure was shaking  
Was there for the taking  
I had the resources  
But then, oh no  
Someone outbid me  
I can't take it with me?  
Then I will devour it  
I can't go without it  
It's simply a question of  
Market forces  
  
Money talks to me  
Whispers in my ear  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want

Laughs right in my face

Saying things will start to happen anyday  
  
And I say when  
So tell me when  
And I say when  
So tell me when  
  
I've heard so much about boats coming in  
Well I've seen no ships so I guess I should swim  
How did I come to get caught in your wake  
The more that I give you the more you still take  
And you always seem to talk and walk away  
Saying things will start to happen any day  
  
And I say when  
So tell me when  
And I say when  
So tell me when  
  
Monday is tuesday then march becomes may  
The days of my life are just ticking away  
  
So I say when  
So tell me when

They simply spread their wings  
The sun shines, it don't ask why  
Or what the whole thing means  
  
The same applies to you and I  
We never question that  
So good, it's just understood  
Ain't no conjecture  
Just a matter of fact  
  
[Chorus:]  
Love is a wonderful thing  
Make ya smile through the pouring rain  
Love is a wonderful thing  
I'll say it again and again  
Turn your world into one sweet dream  
Take your heart and make it sing  
Love, love is a wonderful thing  
  
The only thing a river knows  
Is runnin' to the sea  
And every spring when a flower grows  
It happens naturally  
  
The same magic when you're in my arms  
No logic can define  
Don't know why, just feels so right  
I only know it happens every time

Oh when the cold wind blows  
I know you're gonna be there to warm me  
That's what keeps me goin'  
And our sweet love will keep on growin'

It's what makes honey taste sweet  
It's what makes your life complete

Ying and yang control man's actions  
And both extremes are a natural reaction

Holding onto caring hands  
But there were vampire fangs  
As the angels sang

We pretend to cry but the feelings are gone.

He (She) is my baby and he (she) lives next door.  
Every morning 'fore the sun come up,  
He (she) brings my coffee in my favorite cup.  
That's why I know, yes, I know,

When I'm in trouble and I have no friends,  
I know she'll go with me until the end.  
Everybody asks me how I know.  
I smile at them and say she told me so.

Now if I call her on the telephone,  
And tell her that I'm all alone,  
  
By the time I count from one to four, I hear her on my door.  
In the evening when the sun does down,  
When there is nobody else around,  
She kisses me and he (she) holds me tight.

Farewell the temple master's bells  
His kiosk and his black worm seed  
Courtship solely of his word  
With Eden guaranteed.  
For now Prince Rupert's tears of glass  
Make saffron sabbath eyelids bleed  
Scar the sacred tablet of wax  
On which the Lizards feed.  
Wake your reason's hollow vote  
Wear your blizzard season coat  
Burn a bridge and burn a boat  
Stake a Lizard by the throat.  
Go Polonius or kneel  
The reapers name their harvest dawn  
All your tarnished devil's spoons  
Will rust beneath our corn.  
Now bears Prince Rupert's garden roam  
Across his rain tree shaded lawn  
Lizard bones become the clay-  
And there a Swan is born  
Wake your reasons' hollow vote  
Wear your blizzard season coat  
Burn a bridge and burn a boat  
Stake a Lizard by the throat.  
Gone soon Piepowder's moss-weed court  
Round which upholstered Lizards sold  
Visions to their leaden flock  
Of rainbows' ends and gold.  
Now tales Prince Rupert's peacock brings  
Of walls and trumpets thousand fold  
Prophets chained for burning masks  
And reels of dreams unrolled . . .

Oh the star wind blows right through me, and I never felt so free  
Oh there had to be a crossroad, a place to draw the line  
And it came down to the question, is this life I'm livin' mine

I want to find the edge, risk it all to win

Everything's okay  
Why just before last Christmas  
My baby went away  
  
Across the sea to an island  
While the bridges brightly burn  
So far away from my land  
The valley of the unconcerned  
  
I was walking down the road, man  
Just looking at my shoes  
When God sent me an angel  
Just to chase away my blues  
  
I saw a hundred thousand blackbirds  
Just flying through the sky  
And they seemed to form a teardrop  
From a black haired angel's eye  
  
That tear fell all around me  
And it washed my sins away  
Now everything is cool  
Everything's okay  
  
Everything is cool  
Everything's okay  
Why just before last Christmas  
My baby went away  
  
And I find it real surprising  
For myself to hear me say  
That everything is cool  
Everything's okay  
Everything is cool  
Everything's okay  
  
Why just before last Christmas  
My baby went away.

Gotta go man, gotta go.

I never thought I'd be the one who would play the fool  
But I know love can feel so good and can be so cruel  
It's clear to me the writing is on the wall  
It's clear to me that you don't really love me at all  
And I can't go on this way  
  
We don't stand a chance  
In this wild romance, my tender heart  
Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again  
With my tender heart.  
We don't stand a chance  
In this wild romance, oh it hurts so bad  
Knowing that I'm not the one you want  
I can't hold on to my tender heart  
  
I'm standing at the door  
Don't need this hurt no more  
I'm crying out in vain  
Cause you don't feel my pain.  
  
Maybe it was always going to be this way  
Maybe I'll look back and understand some day  
But now I've got to say  
We don't stand a chance  
In this wild romance, my tender heart  
Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again  
With my tender heart.  
We don't stand a chance  
In this wild romance, oh it hurts so bad  
Knowing that I'm not the one you want  
I can't hold on to my tender heart

Oh without fail everyday since you went away  
The doorbell rings you're sending roses again  
In my room all petals fall but darling that's not all

Choosing what to wear so she can just stand in his street

Jewels around her neck getting strong with the ice

They keep callin' me  
They keep callin', all the lil' homies keep fallin'  
In them same traps niggas can't figure out  
In the fast lane boy but the bridge is out  
Make my blood boil, get yo' life spoiled  
Get you in the system, get you in the soil  
And your funeral was sponsored by Unocal  
Saw you UVN, nigga digital  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know, it's fucked up how they do us  
Pretend they really care, but then they Jerry Lewis  
Take that money that was allocated to us  
Put us in some fucked up trailers then sue us  
Watchin' Katrina, is worser than Ike and Tina  
See New Orleans get bitch-slapped by FEMA  
Louisiana got racist-ass politics  
Free the Jena Six (Nigga free the Jena six!)  
Your honor, Osama, Obama  
Even, yo' momma, ain't fuckin' with my comments  
They want us to quit, forget  
And not give a shit about these sick-ass politics  
A lunatic is in the White House  
Make me wanna go do a lick right now  
But they'll make a nigga bow down  
in the penitentiary, a billion dollar industry

I believe that, homey I believe that  
If I can picture that, I'll bring a picture back

0,"Since it began I got one dream and it's really my only blessing  
If I can come through than so can you  
And you will find there's no regretting  
Things you want from your life's font  
Will never let your spirit roam  
Come back to Earth for what it's worth  
For you've been dreaming of a ceiling not a home  
  
[Chorus]  
I've been doing my best  
What else can I do?  
Is there something I've missed  
That will help you through  
  
I have reached the top of the wall  
And all I've found is another way to fall  
  
For some short time  
For a while you and I were joined to eternity  
Then we split in two back tome and you  
Like the rain rising from the sea  
Rising from the sea  
We all can see what we shall be  
But knowing's not really controlling  
With time perhaps I will pass the traps and find some peace and understanding  
After you'd come and while you're gone  
You leave me guessing, it's depressing  
Never to know the way to go to find some time along a little less pressing  
So you just have to laugh  
When it hurts so much  
You're so far away and so hard to touch  
  
I have reached the top of the wall  
And all I've found is another way to fall  
  
Since it began I got one dream and it's really my only blessing  
If I can come through than so can you  
And you will find there's no regretting  
Things you want from your life's font  
Will never let your spirit roam  
Come back to Earth for what it's worth  
For you've been dreaming of a ceiling not a home

And I took her for granted I was so cavalier  
Now the way that it stands  
She's out of my hands  
  
So I've learned that love's not possession  
And I've learned that love won't wait  
Now I've learned that love needs expression  
But I learned too late  
  
And she's out of my life

Kept my love for her locked deep inside

Under moonshine that's where I've been

Under moonshine that's where I've been  
Under moonshine I'm clearly seen  
  
Creator of dreams that melt with the sun  
I'll send you the things this man has done  
He was a saint and a sinner rolled in one  
But I miss now that he's gone  
I sure miss him now that he's gone  
  
Sure I feel the pain  
Deep inside I pour like rain  
Remember when you smile  
Love's in your eyes  
  
The world keeps turning  
The grass still grows green  
The fruit on my tree  
Is the biggest you've ever seen  
Which way up you know when you're down  
They've gotta stand tall  
With your feet on the ground  
You must stand tall  
With your feet on the ground  
  
Or maybe I'm crazy  
Also they say I'm lazy  
But I'll have my days  
When I do as I please  
For you won't see the woods  
While you're a tree  
No you'll never see the woods  
While you're a tree  
  
Yes I'm crazy  
Also they say I'm lazy

""Something hidden down below the level of your conversation?""  
We he turned away before the answer  
Though I yelled aloud he refused to hear  
It became to clear  
So it went as we put out  
I was left in constant doubt  
Everything I asked about seemed private  
  
The captain strolled the bridge one night  
I stopped him in the evening light  
To ask him would it be all right to join him  
  
But he stood there like some idol  
And he listened like some temple  
And then he turned away  
  
All along the fateful coast  
We moved silent like a ghost  
The timeless sea, a tireless host possessed us  
The wind came building from the cold northwest  
And soon the waves began to crest  
Crashing cross the forward deck  
All hands lost  
  
I alone survived the sinking  
I alone possessed the tools  
On that ship of fools

Have left me with my soul today  
Felicity flies out the door  
When people lose their warmth  
That's a very ordinary bummer  
I'll hold out for summer days  
  
Stand and laugh and run  
In a quiet movie of mine  
I saw a girl with eyes like fire  
I had to look away  
She was swearing like a sailor  
And demanding her own way  
That was when I knew I had to love her  
  
I opened up my sad old eyes  
And let the feelings run  
With a quiet beauty of mine  
Maybe sometimes we do bad things  
And then other times we do good  
And sometimes from something very bad  
Comes something very good  
In a quiet year of mine

No one's to blame  
After the storm, we'll shine  
So rare you and me disagree  
Love's like a sunshower  
Baby, babe  
Somewhere we'll find  
We won't regret  
We won't forget  
Rainbows wait for you and me  
Girl, we're caught in a sunshower  
When we've talked enough  
Can we make up  
Can we make love, ooh  
Yeah

Every night you'll know that I'll be pining  
Every hour a year while I'm away  
Dry those big brown eyes and smile dear  
Banish all those tears and please don't sigh  
Kiss me once again and hold me

But, at least I know where I can turn  
When I'm in my times of need  
Just as long  
(As I know all things are possible)  
Just as long as I believe  
  
I've loved a lot, hurt a lot  
Been burned a lot in my life and times  
Spent precious years wrapped up in fear  
With no end in sight  
Until my saving grace shined on me  
Until my saving grace set me free  
  
Giving me peace  
Giving me strength when I'd  
Almost lost it all  
Catching my every fall  
I still exist because you keep me safe  
I found my saving grace within you  
  
Yes, I've been bruised  
Grew up confused  
Been destitute  
I've seen life from many sides  
Been stigmatized  
Been black and white  
Felt inferior inside  
Until my saving grace shined on me  
Until my saving grace set me free  
  
Giving me peace  
Giving me strength when I'd  
Almost lost it all  
Catching my every fall  
I still exist because you keep me safe  
I found my saving grace within you  
  
And the bountiful things that you do  
Lord thank you  
For delivering me  
  
And giving me peace  
Giving me strength  
Giving me hope when I'd  
Almost lost it all  
Catching my every fall  
I still exist because you keep me safe  
Always my saving grace  
Pulls me through  
I found my saving grace within you

Within you...

Yes lord

Don't let the bluebirds tool ya  
Don't let the women do ya

Oh, advice is fine if you've got a mind  
To listen to the end that's got the time  
But the muse?ll get ya if you don't watch out

An easy way to get out of tune

He said, ""don't let that sunshine fool ya  
Don't let the bluebirds tool ya  
Don't let the women do ya

Well, here's a song for you, child of mine  
I hope you make it through this time  
Get yourself a piece of that rainbow pie  
No reason in the world you can't get by

And don't let the bluebirds tool ya

'Cause you mean that much to me  
You could have told me yourself  
That you loved some one else

Son and none of what you hear  
But I can't help but be confused  
If it's true please tell me dear  
Do you plan to let me go  
For the other guy you loved before?  
  
Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine

And wherever I played Rose could always be found  
Life was hard but we made it and as everyone knows  
I was there when she needed me, a playmate of Rose  
  
Now years have passed, things have changed  
Since we moved into town  
The little girl I grew up with is your woman now I found  
  
And now the sidewalks of the city where  
Wild temptation flows  
Is her new playground and the playmates of Rose  
  
So if you're the one that's holdin' her tight  
Somewhere out there tonight  
Please don't treat her as if she's just another girl  
From off the street  
  
And please, don't do her wrong  
For her pride is almost gone  
For you see Rose means the world to me

The girl that every man knows  
But I love her today so different from your way

And I'm trying not to pull out my hair  
I'm trying hard to grow it but I'm far too shy to grow it back there  
That is probably why I like wearing hats  
There's no denying I'm deferring the facts  
Avoiding confrontation  
Lacks tact in a situation  
Behind every line is a lesson yet to learn  
  
But if you asked me  
The feeling that I'm feeling is overwhelming  
And oh it goes to show  
There's so much to know  
  
I wrote this for my prettiest friend  
But while trying not to prove that I care  
I was trying not to make all my moves in one motion and scare her away  
She can't see she's making me crazy now  
I don't believe she knows she's amazing how  
She has me holding my breath  
So I'd never guess that I'm a nonesuch unsuitable, suitor for her  
  
And if you ask me  
The feeling that I'm feeling is complimentary  
And oh it goes to show  
The moral of the story is boy loves girl  
And so on, but the way that it unfolds is yet to be told  
  
I know that I should be brave  
Even pretty can be seen by the blind  
I know that I cannot wait  
Until the day we finally learn how to find each other  
Redefining open minds  
  
And if you ask me  
The feeling that I'm feeling is overjoyed  
And it's golden, it goes to show then  
The ending of this song should be left alone  
And so on cause the way it unfolds is yet to be told

Western code  
Your private life will suddenly explode  
There'll be phantoms  
There'll be fires on the road  
And the white man dancing  
You'll see a woman  
Hanging upside down  
Her features covered by her fallen gown  
And all the lousy little poets  
Coming round  
Tryin' to sound like charlie manson  
And the white man dancin'

There you'll hold me tight and say

On summer nights.  
  
At the end of the day  
We can go down to the bay  
And together hand in hand  
We will walk along the sand  
On summer nights.  
  
In our little cafe  
We'll dance the night away  
And we know our love will be  
Always true eternally.

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]  
Why are people in this country to get my money and time consuming but it  
It would have the right thing and the fact is the most recent version and the
fact  
I'm so tired and hungry for me and the first place I have no clue who I want  
The fact that you are so much for a long way in hell is going on with a few
years  
And it will not have the right way too long for a few years and it will take
place  
  
[Bridge: Ne-Yo]  
For the first place I want a relationship is the only thing I would have  
It will take place in the morning to the point of view and it will not let the
bed  
I'm at work on a Friday afternoon at a time when the sun goes on the low price  
  
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]  
Why are people in this country to get my money and time consuming but it  
It would have the right thing and the fact is the most recent version and the
fact  
I'm so tired and hungry for me and the first place I have no clue who I want  
The fact that you are so much for a long way in hell is going on with a few

Who'd never let you look inside  
I'd smile when I was crying  
I had nothing but a life to loose  
Thought I had a lot to proof  
In my life, there's no denying  
  
Goodbye to all my yesterdays  
Goodbye, so long, I'm on my way  
  
I've had enough of cryin'  
Bleedin', sweatin', dyin'  
Hear me when I say  
Gonna live my life everyday  
I'm gonna touch the sky  
And I spread these wings and fly  
I ain't here to play  
I'm gonna live my life everyday  
  
Strange, everybody's feeling strange  
Never gonna be the same  
Makes you wonder how the world keeps turning  
Life, learning how to live my life  
Learning how to pick my fights  
Take my shots while I'm still burning  
  
Goodbye to all those rainy nights  
Goodbye, so long, I'm moving on

0,"First thing I remember was asking papa, why,  
For there were many things I didn't know.  
And daddy always smiled and took me by the hand,  
Saying, someday you'll understand.  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,  
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,  
'Cause someday never comes.  
  
Well, time and tears went by and I collected dust.  
For there were many things I didn't know.  
When daddy went away, he said, try to be a man,  
And someday you'll understand.  
  
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,  
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,  
'Cause someday never comes.  
  
And then one day in April, I wasn't even there,  
For there were many things I didn't know.  
A son was born to me. Mama held his hand,  
Sayin' someday you'll understand.  
  
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,  
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,  
'Cause someday never comes  
Ooo someday never comes.  
  
Think it was September, the year I went away,  
For there were many things I didn't know.  
And I still see him standing, tryin' to be a man,  
I said, someday you'll understand.  
  
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,  
That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,  
'Cause someday never comes  
Ooo someday never comes.

The thought of children who must oblige  
To tainted dreams and polluted seas  
The missing moon and melting trees  
  
A mist of doom and clouds of pain  
Toxic waste and acid rain  
The passing of our ignorance  
A lifetime spent in abstinence  
  
Living in fear  
Living in fear  
I can't tell you no lies  
Living in fear  
Living in fear  
  
Conditioning to hate and them to blame  
Their search for God is just the same  
Machines for hearts, how warped a view  
Forgetting that they're human too  
  
Waiting like a branded steer  
Who first will launch the burning spear  
When every day may be your last  
You think we'd learn from our past  
  
Living in fear  
Living in fear  
I can't tell you no lies  
Living in fear  
Living in fear  
  
I smell the fear that rains inside  
The thought of so many lives denied  
More wounded soldiers, another burning flag  
And rows and rows of body bags  
  
No time for tears as the night falls cold  
The days survivors crawl back in their holes  
As for the rest they're shipped back home  
Home to the rows of white tomb stones  
  
Living in fear  
Living in fear  
I can't tell you no lies  
Living in fear  
Living in fear

Bring the guns, bring the bows

You built a great business which benefits all

I remember clearly how you looked  
The night we met  
I recall your laughter and your smile  
I remember how you made me  
Feel so at ease  
I remember all your grace, your style  
  
And now you're all I long to see  
You've come to mean so much to me  
  
Chances are I'll see you  
Somewhere in my dreams tonight  
You'll be smiling like the night we met  
Chances are I'll hold you and I'll offer  
All I have  
  
You're the only one I can't forget  
Baby you're the best, I've ever met  
  
And I'll be dreaming of the future  
And hoping you'll be by my side  
And in the morning I'll be longing  
For the night, for the night  
  
Chances are I'll see you  
Somewhere in my dreams tonight  
You'll be smiling like the night we met  
Chances are I'll hold you and I'll offer  
All I have  
  
You're the only one I can't forget  
Baby you're the best I've ever met

0,"Though this is all you'll ever get  
It would be a strange delight  
No eyes no nose no mind  
The grey light of Porto stay with you  
Oh how can you love a tiny bug impressed  
By the night when you cut yourself?  
Save me save me  
Your body rotten as the last melon on the vine  
Pull your shirt down save me save me  
Press my thumb onto your tongue  
Hand a knife up to me  
No mouth no neck no rest  
The white poem of self hate stays with you  
Even though you know a chance to cut  
Is still a chance to cure  
Pull your legs apart  
Save me save me  
Your body doomed as the last apple on the tree  
So let me hurt you.

On a rainy Saturday, he-he-hey  
Milk and toast, some coffee take the stuffiness  
Out of days you hate, you really hate  
Slow morning news pass me by I try  
Not to analyze but didn't he blow my  
Mind this time  
Didn't he blow my mind?  
  
(here he comes)  
To bring a little lovin' honey  
To take away the hurt  
Inside is everything that matters to me  
Is everything I want in life  
  
Milk and  
Toast and honey  
  
To bring a little lovin', honey  
To take away the pain inside is everything  
That matters to me  
Is everything  
I want from life  
(here he comes)  
Oh lay  
A little lovin', baby  
To feel you're gettin'  
Close to me is everything that matters to me  
Is everything I want to be  
  
Ain't it funny how things sometimes look so  
Clear and feel so near  
The dreams I dream,  
My favorite wishful thinkin'  
Oh he's  
Bookmarked everywhere, everywhere  
True  
Love might fall from the sky  
You never know  
What to find but didn't he blow my mind this time  
Didn't he blow my mind?  
  
(here he comes)
